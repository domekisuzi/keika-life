I think that grading students is rather important. 
Lila pointed out that grades have a discouraging effect on students. 
However, I respectfully disagree. First, the grading system serves as a motivational factor for students, which creates a ==competitive== environment to incentivize them to excel. Moreover, if a student  is easily  discouraged by grading system, he/she  will encounter far more cruel situation when getting into the real society.  （这句话逻辑不是特别严谨）

Conversely, It's more reliable to receive a grade from teachers. Giving  grades forces students to be aware of their own level and push them to strive hard for their goal scores. Also, by grading students, teachers would ==undoubtedly== experience a significant reduction in their workload and stress. Just imagine that teachers have to give different solutions for each personalized feedback they provide, which can be  quite exhausting.

In my opinion, teachers should be judged by the test scores of their students.  
Andrew held the point that it's more reliable to judge a teacher by  a senior teacher. However, I respectfully disagree. It's obviously that almost all of us keep conscious or unconscious biases when assessing other people, so we can not ascertain whether a senior teacher evaluate a junior one out of biases instead of experience. Moreover, a teacher who is lack of knowledge has the ability to improve themselves without a experienced teacher's help.
Conversely, test score provides a public acceptable, clear, and reliable solution. The grading system for teachers offers a standard criteria for both students and their parents, which can obtain the confidences and support from parents and then it gives back to teachers the motivation to strive hard for work. It's totally a win-win situation.
