 

我想的从来都是，哎这个话题我很熟啊，我平时练过啊，那个段子我可以化用啊。你告诉我有很多论证结构可以用，我知道了，但是你希望我知道以后就能用得很6，这就比较困难了。

所以，对于主体段的充实，我个人的方法是通过前期训练，积累不同话题的语料库，在考试时，积极地化用、改用你用起来得心应手的段子，而不是想着我要怎么论证。

事实上，我往往是写完了主体段，回过头去看才发现，我原来用了对比，用了举例，或者是通过让步句来欲扬先抑。

  

那么，应该怎么积累、掌握段子才能在考试时比较轻松自如地用出来？答主的方法是多练习。可能有人要问，多练习，commonplace！谁都知道会有效果，但是如果遇到没练过的话题怎么办，段子用不上去怎么办？答主你希望我们用准备段子的方法来应对考试，这不就是让我们押题吗？谁能保证自己的段子一定能在考试时候用上？我感觉很不靠谱啊。答主对此的回答是，准备段子也是有方法的，**准备段子不等于堆砌段子数量**。题目千千万，靠积累段子数量当然是最傻的做法，正确的方法应该是提高段子的质量。

有人对托福话题做过统计，题目类型无非是以下这15种，并非有些烤鸭想象中那么无边无际。由此，题目的有限性就意味着我们可以通过“万能”段子来灵活应对具体的题目。**“万能”其实也并不是真的万能，倒不如叫做“母段子”，题目虽然是变化多端的，但是它的话题性是不会改变的，你把段子稍加改变写出来就是切题的好句子。**吃透母段子，平时练习的时候积极化用、改写子段子，这种能力在平时练习的时候训练得越多，考试的时候就越能自如地下笔。


**答主自己的练习过程如下，大家辩证参考**

①根据每个话题准备2-3个母段子，母段子在自己可以掌握的范围内越多越好。初时不妨就先准备2-3个段子，之后可以慢慢增加。

② 15个话题，以3-4天为周期，周期内每天限时30分钟写一篇习作

③写的过程中，务必用上你事先背过的母段子，并积极地进行改写

④写完后对改写部分的语法、结构、表意进行修改，形成一个新的子段子。

⑤将母段子、子段子敲下来进行总结，归类，再一次加深印象


答主备战一个月，除了Food、 Aminals、 Family等出现次数较少的话题，基本都写过2-3篇习作，每篇习作都能重新积累2-3个新的子段子，故而在模考的时候，不管拿到什么题目，敲下主体段第一句分论点，脑子里就自然而然地联想到之前写过的类似题目，当时用的是哪个母段子，子段子又是如果改写的。注意一点，这里并不是要求你完整回忆出母段子和子段子，你甚至不需要回忆70%-80%，往往20%-30%就能给你以启发，激发思路，打通文脉。

关于要不要背好词好句好的表达。我的观点一向是，表达和单词都不是单独存在的，只有放在完整的论证结构中才有意义。否则就是写诗，写诗才讲究用词精妙，语句优美。积累段子的过程已经包含了单词和语句的积累，所以并不必单列出来。

**而且，如果单纯背好词好句的一个结果就是，即使你碰巧考试时想起来了，用上了，但是你不知道下一句该写什么，也就是说反而会造成语句之间的割裂，反倒不如你用朴实的语句但确保你的逻辑清楚、前后句联系紧密来得效果好。**

TODO (积累万能素材然后直接运用！熟练运用自己模板，每个五句话左右？)


一篇文章中重复出现的意思需要准备两套， reduce ->    get a minimal  -> experience a significant reduction in their workload and pressure  
promote -> foster  -> encourages 

In my view,  students **benefit from  receiving grade**. (表肯定)

I do agree that offering personalize feedback is helpful to students to some degree .However, for teachers, it demands a significant  amount  of time and greatly increases their workload,　which may place  unnecessary pressure on teachers and ~~lower~~ indirectly reduce  the quality of their judgement. Imaging that after a long's grading  sessions teachers have to face the situation of providing different solutions for  each  specific piece of  feedback the next day to give students incentives to excel.

Conversely, grading system,  not only places (使用一般现在时)teachers under a minimal pressure environment, but also encourages  students to strive hard to  their ideal scores automatically. Everyone who want to achieve high marks  and avoid falling behind of others incentives themselves to hold on to dream.


你的这篇文章大致能 **得 15-18 分（满分 30）**，属于 **中等水平（Fair, 2-3 分档）**，主要问题在于 **语法错误、表达不自然、逻辑不够清晰**。

这意味着自主发挥就是依托狗屎

原稿

In my opinion, students benefit from receiving grades.
Lisa pointed out that grades can have a discouraging effect on students. 
However, I respectfully disagree. The presence of a grading system serves as a motivational factor for students. Grading creates a competitive environment that gives students incentives to excel .  Their desire to avoid falling behind drives them to strive for improvement and tap into their full potential. 
Conversely, personal feedback, while valuable, may not serve as an effective motivator as grades do. With everyone receiving a mix of positive and negative feedback from teachers, it becomes challenging to gauge academic performance, identify who might be ==lagging behind==, or ascertain one's standing relative to peers. ==Consequently==, the absence of healthy competition can dampen their motivation to put in the extra effort in their studies,  

22-25


I believe that grading students is essential.

Lila argued that grades can discourage students, but I disagree. While some may feel disappointed by low scores, grades **motivate students** by fostering competition and pushing them to improve. For example, students aiming for scholarships or college admissions work harder to achieve high grades.

Additionally, **grades prepare students for real-world challenges**. In professional settings, employees are evaluated based on performance, just as students are **assessed** through grades. Learning to handle evaluations early helps students build **resilience**.

Moreover, **grading is more efficient than personalized feedback**. *If teachers had to provide individualized evaluations for every student, their workload would increase significantly.* %%  结构：If + 过去式, 主句 + would/could/might + 动词原形。表可能发生的事情%%==A standardized grading system ensures fairness while maintaining efficiency.==

In conclusion, grades encourage motivation, prepare students for future challenges, and reduce teachers’ stress. Although some may find them discouraging, they remain necessary for academic success.

很多考生即使学会了句式和词汇，但还是写不出高质量文章，主要原因是 **逻辑论证能力不足**。  
可以用 **“Why-How-Example”** 训练法强化论证。

### **（1）"Why-How-Example" 论证法**

**假设题目**：_Should students be required to do volunteer work?_

**低分论证（仅仅表达观点）**：

- _I believe students should do volunteer work because it is beneficial._ ❌（缺少具体论证）
    
**高分论证（用 Why-How-Example 展开）**：
- **Why（为什么？）**: _Volunteer work helps students develop a sense of responsibility._
    
- **How（如何影响？）**: _By participating in volunteer activities, students learn to work in teams and contribute to society._
    
- **Example（具体例子）**: _For instance, students who help at nursing homes often develop empathy and patience, which are essential life skills._

📌 **练习**：

1. 选一篇范文，找出它是如何论证观点的，分析它的 "Why-How-Example" 结构。
    
2. 尝试用相同方法自己构思论证，写 3-5 句话。

In my opinion, teacher should be judged by test scores. 
Andrew argued that teacher evaluation should be decided by senior teachers, however, I respectfully disagree.
It's normal for a person to judge others with one's experience  which  may cause unconsious  basis  during decision, and it's difficulty to eliminate this effect.
So the best way to eval a teacher is test score, which is fair enough and can satisfy all the other people. It's not doubt that when we use scores to judge a thing, although somebody would reflect the result, but with the clear criteria, there would not be too much differences among us. 

14-17  (跑题会额外扣分)

In my opinion, teachers should be judged by the test scores of their students.  
Andrew held the point that it's more reliable to judge a teacher by  a senior teacher. However, I respectfully disagree. It's obviously that almost all of us keep conscious or unconscious biases when assessing other people, so we can not ascertain whether a senior teacher evaluate a junior one out of biases instead of experience. Moreover, a teacher who is lack of knowledge has the ability to improve themselves without a experienced teacher's help. (缺乏逻辑，得给出为什么教师有能力，可以给出具体的例子)
Conversely, test scores provide   ==fair and reliable assessments that are not easily influenced by external factors==  . The grading system for teachers offers a standard criteria for both students and their parents, which can motivate teachers to strive hard to enhance their teaching competence and instruct
