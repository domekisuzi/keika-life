## 1 Grading Students

In my opinions,grading students is a right way to judge. 

Firstly, as we grow up,we have to face with the crul world,

if we use grades to understand how we do in our education

,we can fastly master we should we do to protect us from 

getting rid of by the world. So giving students grades is  really important to make us grow.

Lila argues that  teacher should givepersonalized feedback,I respectlly disagree with it. It  usually spend more time for teacher to do this and they have their own life.It's unreasonable.





### **修改后的版本**

In my opinion, grading students is an appropriate way to evaluate their performance.

Firstly, as we grow up, we must face the harsh realities of the world. By using grades to understand how well we are doing in our education, we can quickly identify the areas we need to improve and take action to avoid being left behind. Therefore, assigning grades to students is crucial for helping them grow and adapt to the competitive world.

Lila argues that teachers should provide personalized feedback. However, I respectfully disagree. Personalized feedback often requires more time and effort from teachers, who also have their own lives and responsibilities. It is not reasonable to expect them to go beyond their capacity to cater to every student individually.

### **具体问题分析**

1. **拼写错误**
   - 原文：crul
   - 修改：harsh
   - "Crul" 应该是 "cruel"，但更自然的表达是 "harsh realities of the world"。
2. **词汇使用**
   - 原文：fastly
   - 修改：quickly
   - "Fastly" 并不是一个正确的英文单词，改为 "quickly" 更加合适。
   - 原文：getting rid of by the world
   - 修改：being left behind
   - "Getting rid of" 不符合语境，改为 "being left behind" 更符合表达。
3. **语法错误**
   - 原文：master we should we do
   - 修改：identify the areas we need to improve
   - 原句结构混乱且用词不当，改为更加流畅和准确的表达。
   - 原文：It usually spend more time
   - 修改：It usually takes more time
   - 动词主谓不一致，改为 "takes" 以符合语法。
4. **逻辑表达**
   - 原文：giving students grades is really important to make us grow
   - 修改：assigning grades to students is crucial for helping them grow
   - 原句表述不够正式，"assigning grades" 更专业，"helping them grow" 更流畅。
5. **格式问题**
   - 将段落分段清晰，增强逻辑性。

### **写作建议**

1. **用词正式化**
   托福写作要求学术化表达，避免使用 "fastly"、"get rid of" 等过于随意或不合适的词汇。
2. **句式多样化**
   你的句子多为简单句，可以适当使用复合句或复杂句来提升句式丰富性。例如：
   - 原句：It usually spend more time for teacher to do this.
   - 修改：Providing personalized feedback requires teachers to dedicate more time, which might interfere with their personal lives.
3. **观点支持更充分**
   在支持"打分"的观点时，可以加上实例或进一步说明，比如：
   - Grades provide a clear standard for both students and parents to measure academic progress. Without grades, it would be harder to objectively evaluate performance.
4. **避免主观词语过多**
   "I think" 或 "In my opinion" 使用过于频繁时，会显得啰嗦，可用更明确的表述替代，如 "It is clear that…"。
