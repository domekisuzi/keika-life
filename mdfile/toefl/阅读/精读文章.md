### Predator-Prey Cycles

How do predators affect populations of the prey animals? The answer is not as simple as might be thought. **Moose(麋，驼鹿)** reached Isle Royale in Lake Superior by crossing over winter ice and multiplied freely there in isolation without predators. When wolves later reached the island, naturalists widely assumed that the wolves would play a key role in controlling the moose population. Careful studies have demonstrated, however, that this is not the case. The wolves eat mostly old or diseased animals that would not survive long anyway. In general, <u>the moose population is controlled by food availability, disease, and other factors rather than by the wolves</u>.

捕食者是怎样影响被捕食者的数量呢？ 答案并不是想象中那么简单。 麋鹿通过穿越冬天的冰层到达了在苏必略湖的罗亚尔岛，并由于没有捕食者而自由繁殖。 当狼在晚一点的时候到达那座岛时，自然学家都认为，狼对控制麋鹿的数量将起到关键作用。 但是，严密的研究说明并不是这样。 狼吃掉的大部分是年老的，或生病的动物，他们本身就不会存活很久。 一般地，麋鹿的数量是由食物、疾病、和其它的一些条件，而不是狼控制的。

When experimental populations are set up under simple laboratory conditions, the predator often **exterminates(**灭绝)** its prey and then becomes extinct itself, having nothing left to eat. However, if safe areas like those prey animals have in the wild are provided, the prey population drops to low levels but not to extinction. Low prey population levels then provide inadequate food for the predators, causing the predator population to decrease. When this occurs, the prey population can rebound. In this situation the predator and prey populations may continue in this cyclical pattern for some time.

在简单的实验条件下，捕食者经常吃掉了所有的实验设定的被捕食者，然后因为食物缺乏而自己灭绝。 但是，如果能给被捕食动物提供如同在野外的安全的区域，被捕食动物的数量会降低到很低的数值，但不会灭绝。 被捕食者的数量的降低造成了捕食者的食物不足，使捕食者的数量下降。 此时，被捕食者的数量又会反弹。这样，一定时间内捕食者和被捕食者的数量会持续地循环。

Population cycles are characteristic of some species of small mammals, and they sometimes appear to be brought about by predators. Ecologists studying hare populations have found that the North American snowshoe hare follows a roughly ten-year cycle. Its numbers fall **tenfold** to **thirtyfold** in a typical cycle, and a **hundredfold** change can occur. Two factors appear to be generating the cycle: food plants and predators.

这种数量的循环是小型哺乳动物的特性，有时候这种循环是由捕食者带来的。 生态学家对野兔数量的研究发现，北美白靴兔一直遵守着大约以十年为周期的循环。 在一个典型的循环中，其数量会以十倍到三十倍的减少，甚至会出现一百倍的改变。 有两种因素会导致这种循环：食物和捕食者。

The preferred foods of snowshoe hares are willow and birch twigs. As hare density increases, the quantity of these twigs decreases, forcing the hares to feed on low-quality, high-fiber food. Lower birth rates, low juvenile survivorship, and low growth rates follow, so there is a corresponding decline in hare **abundance (大量，丰富；繁荣，富裕；数量，丰度)**. Once the hare population has declined, it takes two to three years for the quantity of twigs to recover.

白靴兔比较喜欢的食物是柳木和桦树树枝。 野兔的密度增加时，这些树枝的数量就减少，迫使野兔去吃一些低质量的，高纤维食物。 随之而来的是低生育率，低成活率，低生长率，所以野兔数量随之减少。 一旦野兔数量减少，树枝的数量需要两到三年恢复。

A key predator of the snowshoe hare is the Canada lynx. The Canada lynx shows a ten-year cycle of abundance that parallels the abundance cycle of hares. As hare numbers increase, lynx numbers do too, rising in response to the increased availability of lynx food.

白靴兔的主要捕食者是加拿大山猫。 加拿大山猫的数量呈现了平行于野兔的十年为周期的循环。 野兔数量下降时，山猫的食物供给减少，数量也随之减少。

What causes the predator-prey **oscillations（振荡；振动；摆动）**? Do increasing numbers of hares lead to overharvesting of plants, which in turn results in reduced hare populations, or do increasing numbers of lynx lead to overharvesting of hares? Field experiments carried out by Charles Krebs and coworkers in 1992 provide an answer. Krebs investigated experimental plots in Canada`s Yukon territory that contained hare populations. When food was added to these plots (no food effect) and predators were excluded (no predator effect) from an experimental area, hare numbers increased tenfold and stayed there-the cycle was lost. However, the cycle was retained if either of the factors was allowed to operate alone: if predators were excluded but food was not added (food effect alone), or if food was added in the presence of predators (predator effect alone). Thus, both factors can affect the cycle, which, in practice, seems to be generated by the conjunction of the two factors.

什么造成了捕食者和被捕食者的周期波动呢？ 是野兔数量的增长使得植物被过度采食，随之导致了野兔的减少还是山猫的增加导致了野兔被过度捕食？ 在1992年，Charles Krebs和其合作者的野外试验提供了答案。 Krebs研究了在加拿大Yuhon地区有野兔种群的试验田。 当食物被加到这片试验田（没有食品因素影响）并且将捕食者移去（也没有捕食者因素影响），野兔数量成十倍增加，并且之后保持稳定——不再循环了。 因此，两个因素都可以影响这个循环，即在现实中，循环是两个因素同时作用的结果。

Predators are an essential factor in maintaining communities that are rich and diverse in species. Without predators, the species that is the best competitor for food, shelter, nesting sites, and other environmental resources tends to dominate and exclude the species with which it competes. This phenomenon is known as "competitor exclusion." However, if the community contains a predator of the strongest competitor species, then the population of that competitor is controlled. Thus even the less competitive species are able to survive. For example, sea stars prey on a variety of bivalve mollusks and prevent these bivalves from monopolizing habitats on the sea floor. This opens up space for many other organisms. When sea stars are removed, species diversity falls sharply. Therefore, from the standpoint of diversity, it is usually a mistake to eliminate a major predator from a community.

捕食者是保持群体多样性和数量的必要条件。 没有捕食者时，那种在对食物、庇护所、筑巢点和其它环境资源的争夺中胜出的竞争者，趋向于统治，并且灭绝与其竞争的其它物种。 这种现象被称作“驱逐竞争者”。 但是，如果种群中的具有最强竞争力的物种存在天敌，那这一物种数量就被控制。 因此，竞争力比较弱的物种都会得以生存。 比如，海星捕食各种双壳的软体动物，防止这些双壳动物垄断海底。 这使得其它的很多生物有了生存空间。 海星被移除后，物种多样性大幅度降低。 因此，从多样性的角度说，从一个种群中消除一个主要捕食者通常是错误的决定。

According to paragraph 4, all of the following are true of the food of snowshoe hares EXCEPT:

A. The preferred food for hares consists of willow and birch twigs.

**B. High fiber food is the most nutritious for hares.**

C. **Depletion(损耗,耗尽)** of the supply of willow and birch twigs causes low birth and growth rates.

D. The food supply takes two or three years to recover after a peak in hare population density.

As a result, there are not enough of the strong competitors to **monopolize（垄断）** the environment’s resources.





### Wind Pollination

**Pollen**, a **powdery** substance, which is produced by flowering plants and contains male **reproductive（生殖的，繁殖的；翻印的，复制的）** cells, is usually carried from plant to plant by insects or birds, but some plants rely on the wind to carry their pollen. Wind **pollination（[农学] 授粉（作用））** is often seen as being primitive and wasteful in costly pollen and yet it is surprisingly common, especially in higher latitudes. Wind is very good at moving pollen a long way; pollen can be blown for hundreds of kilometers, and only birds can get pollen anywhere near as far. The drawback is that wind is obviously unspecific as to where it takes the pollen. It is like trying to get a letter to a friend at the other end of the village by climbing onto the roof and throwing an **armful（一抱之量；双手合抱量）** of letters into the air and hoping that one will end up in the friend's garden. For the relatively few **dominant（占支配地位的，占优势的；（基因）显性的）** tree species that make up temperate forests, where there are many individuals of the same species within pollen range, this is quite a safe gamble. If a number of people in the village were throwing letters off roofs, your friend would be bound to get one. By contrast, in the tropics, where each tree species has few, widely scattered individuals, the chance of wind blowing pollen to another individual is sufficiently slim that animals are a safer bet as transporters of pollen. Even tall trees in the tropics are usually not wind pollinated despite being in windy conditions. In a similar way, trees in temperate forests that are insect pollinated tend to grow as **solitary（独自的，单独的；偏僻的，孤立的；独自完成的）**, widely spread individuals.

花粉，一种由开花植物产生且含有雄性生殖细胞的粉状物质通常是由昆虫或鸟类在植物间传播的，但有些植物也靠风来携带花粉。 风媒传粉常被视为是原始和低效率的方式，但这种传粉手段极其常见，特别是在高纬度地区。 风可以把花粉带到很远的地方，远至几百公里，只有鸟类传播才能勉强达到这个距离。 但风媒传播有个缺点，那就是传播的不定向性。 这就好比爬上屋顶，把一大堆信扔到空中，希望其中一封能落在村子另一端的朋友家的花园里。 如果是在只有相对较少的几个树种占主导地位的温带森林，花粉的传播范围内有众多相同的树种，风媒传播就相对低风险的赌博。 这就像是村子里有许多人都把信从屋顶扔下来，你的朋友终归会收到一封。 相比之下，在热带地区，每种树的数量很少，而且散布在各处，靠风把花粉从一棵吹到另一棵的几率太小，这时靠动物来传播花粉就会更保险。 因此，即便是热带的高大树木也不会靠风来传播花粉，即使它们处于大风环境中。 类似地，在温带森林中靠昆虫授粉的树木通常会长成孤立的广泛分布的大树。

Since wind-pollinated flowers have no need to attract insects or other animals, they have **dispensed with（免除 ; 省掉 ; 无需 ; 省略）** bright **petals**, **nectar**, and **scent**. These are at best a waste and at worst an **impediment（妨碍，障碍；口吃，结巴）** to the transfer of pollen in the air. The result is insignificant-looking flowers and **catkins** (dense cylindrical clusters of small, petalless flowers).

由于风媒传粉的花不需要吸引昆虫或其它动物，它们无需鲜艳的花瓣，诱人的花蜜与花香。 因为这些东西对于风媒传粉的花来说充其量只是多余的，搞不好还会变成花粉在空中传播的阻碍。 所以这些花只有不起眼的外观和**花序**（密集的圆柱状、无花瓣小花团）。

Wind pollination does, of course, require a lot of pollen. Birch and **hazel** trees can produce 5.5 and 4 million grains per catkin, respectively. There are various adaptations to help as much of the pollen go as far as possible. <u>Most **deciduous（落叶性的，脱落性的；非永久性的）** wind-pollinated trees (which shed their leaves every fall) produce their pollen in the spring while the branches are bare of leaves to reduce the surrounding surfaces | that "compete" with the **stigmas(耻辱，污名；（植物花朵的）柱头)** (the part of the flower that receives the pollen) for pollen. Evergreen **conifers（针叶树；[植] 松柏科植物）**, which do not shed their leaves, have less to gain from spring flowering, and, indeed, some flower in the autumn or winter.</u>

当然，风媒传粉需要大量的花粉。 桦树和榛子树的每个花序可分别能产生550万和400万粒花粉。 要使得更多的花粉传得更远，植物们各有各的适应方式。 大多数风媒传粉的落叶植物（每年秋天落叶的植物）在春天产出花粉，这时候树枝光秃秃的，花粉就有更大几率落到柱头（接收花粉的部分）上，落到树的表面上的部分就不会太多。 常绿针叶树由于不会落叶，春天开花对它们来说并没有什么好处，因此，确实会有部分树在秋天或冬天开花。

Pollen produced higher in the top branches is likely to go farther: it is windier (and **gustier(阵风的；突发的；阵阵猛急的)**) and the pollen can be blown farther before hitting the ground. Moreover, **dangling(摇晃（dangle 的 ing 形式）,悬挂的；摇摆的)** catkins like hazel hold the pollen in until the wind is strong enough to bend them, ensuring that pollen is only shed into the air when the wind is blowing hard. Weather is also important. Pollen is shed primarily when the air is dry to prevent too much sticking to wet surfaces or being knocked out of the air by rain. Despite these adaptations, much of the pollen fails to leave the top branches, and only between 0.5 percent and 40 percent gets more than 100 meters away from the parent. But once this far, significant quantities can go a kilometer or more. Indeed, pollen can travel many thousands of kilometers at high altitudes. Since all this pollen is floating around in the air, it is **no wonder that(难怪)** wind-pollinated trees are a major source of allergies.

越高的树枝上产生的花粉，就越有可能飘得越远，因为高处风更多（也更大），花粉在落地前也就可以吹得更远。 此外，悬挂的榛序直到被风吹弯了才会把花粉释放出来，确保花粉只在风力够强时脱落进入空气中。 天气也很重要。 只有当空气干燥的时候，花粉才会被释放出来，以防止花粉被潮湿的表面粘住或者被雨打落到地面。 尽管有这些适应方式，大部分花粉还是无法离开顶端的树枝，只有千分之五到百分之四十的花粉能够飘到离树木100米以外的地方。 不过飘过100米后，这些花粉相当一大部分就能飘到一公里或者之外的地方。 事实上，花粉可以在高海拔地区飘至数千公里外。 有这些花粉在空气中漂浮，难怪风媒传粉的树是过敏的主要来源。

Once the pollen has been **snatched(一把抓住，立马夺下；夺去)** by the wind, the fate of the pollen is obviously up to the **vagaries(奇思遐想；变幻莫测（vagary 的复数）)** of the wind, but not everything is left to chance. Windborne pollen is dry, rounded, smooth, and generally smaller than that of insect-pollinated plants. But size is a two-edged sword. Small grains may be blown farther but they are also more **prone(有做……倾向的，易于……的；俯卧的，趴着的；（前臂姿势）手心向下的)** to be whisked past the waiting stigma because smaller particles tend to stay trapped in the fast-moving air that flows around the stigma. But stigmas create **turbulence(骚乱，动荡；（空气或水的）湍流，紊流)**, which slows the air speed around them and may help pollen stick to them.

一旦花粉被风带走，花粉的命运就交给喜怒无常的风了，但也并非说一切都取决于运气。 风传花粉是干燥的，圆形的，光滑的，比虫媒传粉的植物的花粉小。 但是花粉的大小是一把双刃剑。 小花粉可能被吹得更远，但它们也更容易拂过花的柱头，因为较小的颗粒会被困在在柱头周围快速流动的空气中。 但与此同时柱头处也会有动荡，从而降低风速，有助于花粉附着在柱头上。



.Wind-pollinated plants usually have small petalless flowers which often grow in catkins that produce a very **fine-grained** pollen.





### Groundwater

Groundwater is the word used to describe water that **saturates( P355 湿透的；（溶液）饱和的，（有机分子）饱和的；充满的；（颜色）深的)** the ground, filling all the available spaces. By far the most abundant type of groundwater is **meteoric（大气的；流星的；疾速的）** water; this is the groundwater that circulates as part of the water cycle. Ordinary meteoric water is water that has **soaked（P329 浸泡；使湿透，浸湿；（液体）渗入，渗透）** into the ground from the surface, from **precipitation(降水)** (rain and snow) and from lakes and streams. There it remains, sometimes for long periods, before emerging at the surface again. At first thought it seems incredible that there can be enough space in the "solid" ground underfoot to hold all this water.

地下水是指渗入到地下并将所有岩石孔隙填满的水。到现在为止，大气水是最丰富的地下水资源，是地下水在水循环中的一个环节。普通的大气水会从地表、降水以及湖泊河流侵入到地下。在再次冒出地表之前，这些地下水有时会长时间留在地下。最初让人觉得难以置信的是，在我们脚下“坚实的”土地中竟然有足够的空间能储存这么些水。

The necessary space is there, however, in many forms. The commonest spaces are those among the particles-sand **grains（谷物，谷粒；颗粒，细粒；少量；纹理；）** and tiny **pebbles(鹅卵石)**-of loose, unconsolidated sand and **gravel（P243 碎石，砂砾）**. Beds of this material, out of sight beneath the soil, are common. They are found wherever fast rivers carrying loads of **coarse（P304 粗糙的，粗织的；粗的，大颗粒的）** sediment once flowed. For example, as the great ice sheets that covered North America during the last ice age steadily melted away, huge volumes of water flowed from them. The water was always **laden(负载的；装满的；苦恼的)** with pebbles, gravel, and sand, known as glacial **outwash([地质] 冰水沉积；消融，冲蚀)**, that was deposited as the flow slowed down.

然而，地下水所需的储存空间多种多样。松散的砂子和砾石间有许多颗粒，如沙粒和小石子，它们之间的孔隙是最常见的储存地下水的空间。由这些颗粒组成的水床非常普遍，通常位于看不见的土壤下方，在携带粗糙沉淀物的湍急的河流曾流过的地方都能找到它们的踪迹。比如，冰河时代覆盖北美的巨大冰层逐渐融化，大量水从那儿流出。水里总会携带些石子、砾石和沙石，这些颗粒会随着水流的减速而沉淀，这就是所谓冰河期的冰水沉积。

The same thing happens to this day, though on a smaller scale, wherever a sediment-laden river or stream emerges from a mountain valley onto relatively flat land, dropping its load as the current slows: the water usually spreads out **fanwise(（展开）呈扇形)**, depositing the sediment in the form of a smooth, fan-shaped slope. Sediments are also dropped where a river slows on entering a lake or the sea, the deposited sediments are on a lake floor or the seafloor at first, but will be located inland at some future date, when the sea level falls or the land rises; such beds are sometimes thousands of meters thick.

现代也有冰水沉积，尽管规模相对较小。凡是有携带沙石的河流或者溪流从山谷流至相对平坦的地面时，砂石就随着水流速度的减慢逐渐沉淀；水流通常呈扇形扩散，它们所携带的沙石也会沉淀为光滑的扇形斜面。当河流汇入湖泊和海洋的时候也会有沉淀，这些沉淀最初在湖底或海底，但将来海平面下降或者陆地崛起时，它们就会分布于内陆，通常厚达几千米。

In lowland country almost any spot on the ground may overlie what was once the bed of a river that has since become buried by soil; if they are now below the water's upper surface (the water table), the gravels and sands of the former riverbed, and its sandbars, will be saturated with groundwater.

低地区域上的任何位置可能就是曾经的河床，后续被土壤覆盖而变成现在的样子。如果那些过去的河床和沙洲现在位于地下水位之下，一定会有大量的地下水浸在它们的沙子和砾石之间。

So much for unconsolidated sediments. Consolidated (or cemented) sediments, too, contain millions of minute water-holding **pores(P258 [陶瓷]气孔；毛穴)**. This is because the gaps among the original grains are often not totally **plugged(堵塞的；塞紧的)** with **cementing(胶接；粘合；凝结)** chemicals; also, parts of the original grains may become dissolved by **percolating(P278 渗透的)** groundwater, either while consolidation is taking place or at any time afterwards. The result is that sandstone, for example, can be as porous as the loose sand from which it was formed.

以上说的都是松散的沉积物，那些坚固的沉积物，也拥有以数万计的毛细孔来容纳水。因为最初颗粒间的缝隙通常并未完全被黏固的化学物质塞满，而且部分颗粒很可能在固化时或固化后被渗入的地下水溶解；结果这些砂岩最终变得和形成它的散沙一样多孔。

Thus a proportion of the total volume of any sediment, loose or cemented, consists of empty space. Most **crystalline（透明的；水晶般的；水晶制的）** rocks are much more solid; a common exception is basalt, a form of solidified volcanic lava, which is sometimes full of tiny bubbles that make it very porous.

因此，不管沉积物是疏松还是坚固，它们中一定有空间。大部分结晶体岩石都非常坚硬，但也有例外，最常见的就是玄武岩，它是一种固化的火山熔岩，经常充满了微小气泡，从而变得十分多孔。

The proportion of empty space in a rock is known as its porosity. But note that porosity is not the same as permeability, which measures the ease with which water can flow through a material; this depends on the sizes of the individual cavities and the **crevices（P235 裂缝；裂隙）** linking them.

岩石的孔隙度就是指其中空间的比例。但需要注意的是，孔隙度与渗透率是不同的。渗透率衡量的是水渗透物质的难易程度，它取决于与单个空隙以及连接孔隙间裂缝的大小。

Much of the water in a sample of water-saturated sediment or rock will drain from it if the sample is put in a suitable dry place. But some will remain, clinging to all solid surfaces. It is held there by the force of surface tension without which water would drain instantly from any wet surface, leaving it totally dry. The total volume of water in the saturated sample must therefore be thought of as consisting of water that can, and water that cannot, drain away.

当充满水分的沉淀物或者岩石样本被放置在适宜的干燥环境中时，大部分的水分会流失，但仍有部分水会继续附着在坚实的表面上。要不是因为表面张力，这些水分也会立刻蒸发，仅留下完全干燥的样本。因此，试验样本的含水量既包括可以流干的水，也包括不能流干的水。

The relative amount of these two kinds of water varies greatly from one kind of rock or sediment to another, even though their porosities may be the same. What happens depends on pore size. If the pores are large, the water in them will exist as drops too heavy for surface tension to hold, and it will drain away; but if the pores are small enough, the water in them will exist as thin **films(薄膜)**, too light to overcome the force of surface tension holding them in place; then the water will be firmly held.

这两种水的相对含量因岩石或沉积物种类不同而改变，即便它们有相同比例的孔隙，还取决于孔隙的大小。如果孔隙很大，其中的水会形成水滴，太重足以克服吸引它的表面张力，就会流走；但如果孔隙够小，水会像薄膜一样，太轻无法克服表面张力，从而稳稳地附着在孔隙表面上。

### The Origins of Theater

In seeking to describe the origins of theater, one must rely primarily on speculation, since there is little **concrete（确实的，具体的；实在的，有形的；混凝土的；物质的）** evidence on which to draw. The most widely accepted theory, championed by anthropologists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, envisions theater as emerging out of **myth（错误的观点，荒诞的说法；神话，神话故事；虚构的人（或事），想象中的人（或事））** and ritual. The process perceived by these **anthropologists** may be summarized briefly. During the early stages of its development, a society becomes aware of forces that appear to influence or control its food supply and well-being. Having little understanding of natural causes, it attributes both desirable and undesirable occurrences to supernatural or magical forces, and it searches for means to win the **favor（帮助；提拔；徽章；赞同；偏袒；同意性交）** of these forces. Perceiving an apparent connection between certain actions performed by the group and the result it desires, the group repeats, refines, and formalizes those actions into fixed ceremonies, or rituals.

由于几乎没有具体材料可供研究，探寻戏剧的起源只能凭推测。19世纪末20世纪初，为**人类学家**们所拥护的一种理论得到了世人的广泛认同；这种观点认为戏剧起源于神话和宗教仪式。这些人类学家们推论过程可简要概括如下：在社会发展早期，人们相信有股力量可以影响甚至操控他们的食物供应和幸福生活。在对自然原因并不十分了解的情况下，他们把希望或不希望发生的事情都归咎于超自然的或魔幻的力量，并且试图寻找各种途径赢得这些力量的厚爱。当他们意识到自己的某些行为和期许的结果之间存在明显的联系以后，人们便开始重复并且完善这些行为，最终形成固定的典礼或宗教仪式。（戏剧起源不明，人们开始主要因为myth和ritual，然后不断完善）

Stories (myths) may then grow up around a ritual. Frequently the myths include representatives of those supernatural forces that the rites celebrate or hope to influence. Performers may wear costumes and masks to represent the mythical characters or supernatural forces in the rituals or in accompanying celebrations. As a people becomes more **sophisticated（P382 见多识广的，老练的，见过世面的；复杂巧妙的，先进的）**, its conceptions of supernatural forces and causal relationships may change. As a result, it may abandon or modify some **rites(*n.*（宗教等的）仪式；礼节，惯例)**. But the myths that have grown up around the rites may continue as part of the group's oral tradition and may even come to be acted out under conditions divorced from these rites. When this occurs, the first step has been taken toward theater as an **autonomous(自治的，有自治权的；自主的，有自主权的；自动的)** activity, and thereafter entertainment and **aesthetic(P238 审美的，美学的；美的，艺术的)** values may gradually replace the former mystical and socially **efficacious(有效的；灵验的)** concerns.

故事（神话）在这种仪式中发展起来，这些故事中经常会有仪式庆祝或期望影响的超自然力量的典型。在这种仪式或伴随的庆典中，表演者们可能会穿上戏装戴上面具来扮演神秘的角色或超自然力量。当人们认识事物的能力进一步加强的时候，他们对超自然力量以及与其引发的事件间因果关系的认识就发生了改变；于是，他们会抛弃或者修改某些仪式。不过在这些仪式中发展起来的神话故事继续在人们的口头流传，甚至可能脱离了仪式而被演绎着。这时侯，戏剧做为一种自发的活动迈出了自己的第一步，接着，戏剧的娱乐和审美价值开始渐渐取代先前的带有神话色彩的、在社会上灵验的关注。

Although origin in ritual has long been the most popular, it is by no means the only theory about how the theater came into being. **Storytelling(讲故事；说谎话)** has been proposed as one alternative. Under this theory, relating and listening to stories are seen as fundamental human pleasures. Thus, the recalling of an event (a hunt, battle, or other feat) is elaborated through the narrator's **pantomime(哑剧；舞剧；手势)** and **impersonation(扮演；模仿；装扮)** and eventually through each role being assumed by a different person.

尽管戏剧起源于宗教仪式的说法是目前最被大众认可的，但无论如何这都不是戏剧起源的唯一理论；另一种推测认为戏剧源于说书。在这个理论中，与故事产生联系和聆听故事被视为是人类基本的乐趣。因此，讲述人通过自己的手势和模仿把对一个事件的回忆（一次打猎、战役或是其它功勋伟业）表现得淋漓尽致，这种方式最终演变成为由不同的人来演绎不同的角色。

A closely related theory sees theater as evolving out of dances that are primarily pantomimic, rhythmical or **gymnastic(体操的，体育的)**, or from imitations of animal noises and sounds. Admiration for the performer's skill, **virtuosity(精湛技巧；对艺术品的爱好；艺术爱好者)**, and **grace(优美，优雅；文雅，高雅；风度，体面；恩宠，恩典；饭前感恩祷告；宽限期，延缓期；大人)** are seen as motivation for elaborating the activities into fully realized theatrical performances.

另外一种与之相关的理论认为，戏剧主要是从无声的、有节奏的舞蹈、体操，或模仿动物声音的过程逐渐演变而来。人们对表演者的演技、审美能力和优雅的欣赏被视为是表演者将他们的表演精心策划为戏剧的动力。

In addition to exploring the possible antecedents of theater, scholars have also theorized about the motives that led people to develop theater. Why did theater develop, and why was it valued after it **ceased(P219 终止，结束)** to fulfill the function of ritual? Most answers fall back on the theories about the human mind and basic human needs. One, <u>set forth（陈述，提出；出发；陈列；宣布）</u> by **Aristotle** in the fourth century B.C.,sees humans as naturally imitative-as taking pleasure in imitating persons, things, and actions and in seeing such imitations. Another, advanced in the twentieth century, suggests that humans have a gift for fantasy, through which they seek to reshape reality into more satisfying forms than those encountered in daily life. Thus, fantasy or fiction (of which drama is one form) permits people to **objectify（（使）具体化，（使）客观化；（使）物化，（使）人格物化）** their anxieties and fears, confront them, and fulfill their hopes in fiction if not fact. The theater, then, is one tool whereby people define an world or escape from unpleasant realities.

为了进一步探寻戏剧的起源，一些学派开始从人类发展戏剧的动机上建立理论。为什么戏剧会发展，为什么在戏剧完全脱离宗教仪式以后还有这么大的价值？大部分答案都回到那些关于人类心智和人类基本需求的理论中。首先，**亚里士多德**在公元前4世纪提出，人们天生好模仿，并从模仿他人、事物和动作以及观看模仿中获得乐趣。另外，20世纪提出的先进理论认为人类擅长幻想，通过幻想将日常生活中的现实重塑成更加令人满意的形式。因此，人们通过幻想或虚构（戏剧的一个形式）把他们的焦虑和恐惧具体化，再通过这种方式面对焦虑和恐惧，并从虚构中满足他们现实中无法实现的愿望。所以，戏剧成为了一种帮助人们认识和理解这个世界，或是帮助人们逃避不满现实的工具。

But neither the human imitative **instinct（P448 本能，天性；直觉；天分，天赋）** nor a **penchant(嗜好；倾向)** for fantasy by itself leads to an autonomous theater. Therefore, additional explanations are needed. One necessary condition seems to be a somewhat **detached(超然的，不带感情的，客观的；单独的，分离的)** view of human problems. For example, one sign of this condition is the appearance of the comic vision, since comedy requires sufficient detachment to view some **deviations( 偏离，违背；离差，偏差)** from social norms as ridiculous rather than as serious threats to the welfare of the entire group. Another condition that contributes to the development of autonomous theater is the emergence of the aesthetic sense. For example, some early societies ceased to consider certain rites essential to their well-being and abandoned them; nevertheless, they retained as parts of their oral tradition the myths that had grown up around the rites and admired them for their artistic qualities rather than for their religious usefulness.

但是，无论是人类模仿的本能或是对幻想的嗜好本身都不能发展成为独立的戏剧，因此，我们需要更多解释。一个必要的条件可能是一种要脱离通常人们看待问题的视角。比如，这个条件的一个标志是喜剧构想的出现，因为喜剧要求足够的发散思维，我们需要将社会规范中的离经叛道的行为视作极其荒谬的事情，而不是对公众群体福利的严重威胁。另一个导致戏剧独立的条件是审美感觉的出现。例如，一些早期社会的人们认为有的仪式对他们的幸福生活来说不再是必需品，并且取消了那些仪式。虽然如此，人们还是保留了那些口头传述故事的传统并且热爱从这些仪式里发展起来的神话，出于它们的艺术性，而不是宗教原因。

Myths sometimes survived in a society’s tradition because of their artistic qualities even after they were no longer **deemed(认为，相信)** religiously beneficial.



A. The presence of theater in almost all societies is thought to have occurred because early storytellers traveled to different groups to tell their stories.

**B. Many theorists believe that theater arises when societies act out myths to preserve social well-being.**

C. The more sophisticated societies became, the better they could influence desirable occurrences through ritualized theater.

D. Some theories of theater development focus on how theater was used by group leaders to group leaders govern other members of society.

**E. Theater may have come from pleasure humans receive from storytelling and moving rhythmically.**

**F. The human capacities for imitation and fantasy are considered possible reasons why societies develop theater.**

Anthropologists have developed many theories to help understand why and how theater originated.



### The Origins of Cetaceans

It should be obvious that cetaceans-whales, porpoises, and dolphins-are mammals. They breathe through lungs, not through gills, <u>and give birth to live young</u>. <u>Their streamlined bodies, the absence of **hind(P384 后部的)** legs, and the presence of a **fluke** and **blowhole** cannot **disguise(P45  假扮，伪装；掩饰，隐瞒)** their **affinities()** with land **dwelling（ 住宅，住所，公寓）** mammals.</u> However, unlike the cases of sea **otters** and pinnipeds (**seals**, sea lions, and walruses, whose limbs are functional both on land and at sea), it is not easy to envision what the first whales looked like. Extinct but already fully marine cetaceans are known from the fossil record. How was the gap between a walking mammal and a swimming whale bridged? <u>Missing until recently were fossils clearly **intermediate（居中的，中间的；中等程度的，中级的）**, or **transitional（暂时的，转型的，过渡的；（建筑）过渡式样的）**, between land mammals and cetaceans.</u>

众所周知，鲸类动物是哺乳动物,如鲸鱼、鼠海豚和海豚。它们用肺呼吸，而不是鳃，属于胎生。鲸类动物呈流线型的身体，后腿的消失，尾片和气孔的出现，这些特征都不能掩饰它们和陆生哺乳动物的相似之处。然而，想知道世上第一只鲸长什么样并非易事，不像还原海獭及鳍足类动物（四肢水陆两用如海豹，海狮，海象）的原貌那么简单。一些完全水生的鲸类动物虽然已经灭绝，但仍可通过化石来对它们进行考察。陆栖哺乳动物和海洋鲸类之间有何联系？近期发现的化石已经可以很清晰地帮助人们了解这个问题，以及他们之间的过渡关系。

Very exciting discoveries have finally allowed scientists to **reconstruct** the most likely origins of cetaceans. In 1979, a team looking for fossils in northern Pakistan found what proved to be the oldest fossil whale. The fossil was officially named Pakicetus <u>in honor of</u> the country where the discovery was made. Pakicetus was found embedded in rocks formed from river deposits that were 52 million years old. The river that formed these deposits was actually not far from an ancient ocean known as the Tethys Sea.

科学家们通过一些令人振奋的发现重现了鲸类动物几近真实的起源。1979年，在巴基斯坦北部，一个寻找化石的考察队发掘到了最古老的鲸鱼化石。这块化石被官方命名为 Pakicetus，以纪念人们发现它的地方。这块化石是在一条河的沉积岩中发现的，这条河有5200万年的历史，离古地中海不远.

The fossil consists of a complete skull of an **archaeocyte**, an extinct group of ancestors of modern cetaceans. Although limited to a skull, the Pakicetus fossil provides precious details on the origins of cetaceans. The skull is cetacean-like but its jawbones lack the enlarged space that is filled with fat or oil and used for receiving underwater sound in modern whales. Pakicetus probably detected sound through the ear opening as in land mammals. The skull also lacks a blowhole, another cetacean adaptation for diving. Other features, however, show experts that Pakicetus is a transitional form between a group of extinct flesh- eating mammals, the mesonychids, and cetaceans. It has been suggested that Pakicetus fed on fish in shallow water and was not yet adapted for life in the open ocean. It probably **bred(繁育 breed的过去分词)** and gave birth on land.

Pakicetus包括一个完整原始动物的头盖骨，它的主人是现代鲸类的祖先。尽管只是个头盖骨，但它却提供了研究原始鲸类动物起源的珍贵信息。这个头盖骨和鲸类动物的很像，但它的下颌骨和现代鲸类略有不同，现代鲸类动物的下颌骨中含有额外的空间储存脂肪或者油脂来吸收水下的声音。Pakicetus的主人可能会像陆生哺乳动物那样通过张开的耳朵来探测声音。另外，这个头盖骨没有呼吸孔，而鲸类动物有，这便是鲸类动物为了适应水生环境的另一种适应性表现。然而，专家认为Pakicetus的其它特征表明它们是已灭绝的食肉哺乳动物（中兽科动物）和鲸类动物的过渡型。有人认为Pakicetus靠吃浅水的鱼类为生，未能适应在辽阔的大海里生活。它们很有可能在陆地进行生育繁殖。

Another major discovery was made in Egypt in 1989. Several skeletons of another early whale, Basilosaurus, were found in sediments left by the Tethys Sea and now exposed in the Sahara desert. This whale lived around 40 million years ago, 12 million years after Pakicetus. Many incomplete skeletons were found but they included, for the first time in an archaeocyte, a complete hind leg that features a foot with three tiny toes. Such legs would have been far too small to have supported the 50-foot-long Basilosaurus on land. Basilosaurus was undoubtedly a fully marine whale with possibly nonfunctional, or **vestigial（P442 退化的；残余的；发育不全的）**, hind legs.

1989年，在埃及有了另一个重大发现。人们在古地中海残留的沉积物中发现了另一类早期鲸鱼Basilosaurus的一些骨骸，这些骨骸如今暴露在撒哈拉大沙漠上。Basilosaurus生活在大约4000万年前，比Pakicetus鲸鱼晚了1200万年。尽管发现的这些骨骼并不完整，但这是专家们第一次在原始动物身上发现完整的后肢，它有三个小脚趾作为的足部特征。可这些后肢还太小，远无法支撑50英尺长的Basilosaurus在陆地行走。因此，Basilosaurus必定是完全水生的鲸鱼，它们的后肢已经不起任何作用，或者说已经退化.

An even more exciting find was reported in 1994, also from Pakistan. The now extinct whale Ambulocetus natans ("the walking whale that swam") lived in the Tethys Sea 49 million years ago. It lived around 3 million years after Pakicetus but 9 million before Basilosaurus. The fossil luckily includes a good portion of the hind legs. The legs were strong and ended in long feet very much like those of a modern pinniped. The legs were certainly functional both on land and at sea. The whale retained a tail and lacked a fluke, the major means of locomotion in modern cetaceans. The structure of the backbone shows, however, that Ambulocetus swam like modern whales by moving the rear portion of its body up and down, even though a fluke was missing. The large hind legs were used for propulsion in water. On land, where it probably bred and gave birth, Ambulocetus may have moved around very much like a modern sea lion. It was undoubtedly a whale that linked life on land with life at sea. . Fluke: the two parts that constitute the large triangular tail of a whale2.

1994年，巴基斯坦报道了一个更令人兴奋的发现。目前已经灭绝的鲸鱼Ambulocetus natans（可以步行的鲸类）4900万年前曾在古地中海生活过。比Pakicetus晚大约 300万年，比Basilosaurus早 900万年左右。幸运的是，被发现的Ambulocetus natans保留着完整的后肢。它的后肢很强壮，底部有长足，非常像现在的鳍足类动物。这些后肢使得他们既能在陆地行走又能在海里游行。虽然Ambulocetus natans保留了尾巴，但它们缺少现代水生鲸类动物用于行动的主要身体部位——尾片。不过，从Ambulocetus的脊椎结构上可以看出，即使缺少尾片，它们也能像现代鲸鱼那样通过身体背部的上下摆动来游走。大的后肢通常被当作是水中前行的发动机。在它们可能交配繁殖的陆地上，Ambulocetus行动起来非常像现代海狮。毫无疑问，鲸鱼是连接着陆地生命和海洋生命的物种。

### Desert Formation

The deserts, which already occupy approximately a fourth of the Earth's land surface, have in recent decades been increasing at an alarming pace. The expansion of desertlike conditions into areas where they did not previously exist is called desertification. It has been estimated that an additional one-fourth of the Earth's land surface is **threatened** by this process.

沙漠已经占据了地球陆地面积约四分之一，而且最近几十年正以惊人的速度扩张。沙漠化是指类似沙漠的环境漫延到原本并非沙漠的区域。据估计，地球表面另外四分之一的地方正面临沙漠化威胁。

Desertification is accomplished primarily through the loss of stabilizing natural vegetation and the subsequent accelerated erosion of the soil by wind and water. In some cases the loose soil is blown completely away, leaving a **stony(石头覆盖的，多石的；石制的)** surface. In other cases, the finer particles may be removed, while the sand-sized particles are accumulated to form mobile **hills** or **ridges（P430 山脊，山脉；屋脊；隆起部分，脊状突起；）** of sand.

沙漠化主要通过以下过程实现：首先自然植被不断减少，随后风力和雨水加速了土壤的腐蚀。有的时候松散的土壤全部被风刮走，留下石质化的表层；其它情况下细小的沙粒可能会被吹走，而正常沙粒大小的砂子不断堆积，从而形成移动的沙丘或者沙脊。

Even in the areas that retain a soil cover, the reduction of vegetation typically results in the loss of the soil's ability to absorb substantial quantities of water. The impact of raindrops on the loose soil tends to transfer fine clay particles into the tiniest soil spaces, **sealing** them and producing a surface that allows very little water penetration. Water absorption is greatly reduced; consequently runoff is increased, resulting in accelerated erosion rates. The gradual drying of the soil caused by its diminished ability to absorb water results in the further loss of vegetation, so that a cycle of progressive surface **deterioration(P284 恶化)** is established.

即便是在保留了土壤表层的区域，植被减少也已成为土壤大量吸取地下水的能力下降的典型因素。雨水对松散土壤的冲击会把细小的粘土颗粒冲到土壤空隙中，封闭了土壤并降低土地表层水的渗透率。地表对水的吸收急剧减少，大量水资源流失，因此土壤的腐蚀率也随即增加。地表吸收水分的能力进一步弱化使得土壤越发干燥，导致植被的进一步流失，于是便形成了土壤沙漠化的恶性循环。

In some regions, the increase in desert areas is occurring largely as the result of a trend toward drier climatic conditions. Continued gradual global warming has produced an increase in **aridity(P100 干旱；乏味)** for some areas over the past few thousand years. The process may be accelerated in subsequent decades if global warming resulting from air pollution seriously increases.

在一些地方，沙漠面积的扩大很大程度上归因于干燥的气候条件。在过去的几千年里，不断增加的温室效应使得一些地方干旱问题愈发严重。倘若空气污染带来的温室效应继续恶化，沙漠化进程会在未来数十年内加速实现。

There is little doubt, however, that desertification in most areas results primarily from human activities rather than natural processes. The **semiarid(半干旱的；雨量非常少的)** lands bordering the deserts exist in a delicate ecological balance and are limited in their potential to adjust to increased environmental pressures. Expanding populations are subjecting the land to increasing pressures to provide them with food and fuel. In wet periods, the land may be able to respond to these stresses. During the dry periods that are common phenomena along the desert margins, though, the pressure on the land is often far in excess of its **diminished(P246 减减弱，降低，减少；贬低，)** capacity, and desertification results.

然而，可以肯定的是，大部分地区沙漠化主要都是由于人类活动造成，而非自然条件导致。沙漠边缘的半干旱土地所处的生态平衡环境非常脆弱，环境压力持续增加，而这些半干旱区域适应环境压力的能力极其有限。人口数量的增加使得人们不断向土地施压，依其提供食物和燃料。在湿润的季节里，土地兴许能够应付这些压力。但是在干旱的季节里，在沙漠周边的土地上，存在着这样一个十分普遍的现象：人类对土地施加的压力远远超过了土地自身减压的能力，因此最终形成了沙漠。

Four specific activities have been identified as major contributors to the desertification processes: overcultivation, overgrazing, firewood gathering, and overirrigation. The cultivation of crops has expanded into progressively drier regions as population densities have grown. These regions are especially likely to have periods of severe dryness, so that crop failures are common. Since the raising of most crops necessitates the prior removal of the natural vegetation, crop failures leave extensive <u>**tracts of(大片的，广阔的：用于描述一片广阔的土地或区域。)**</u> land **devoid(P177 缺乏，完全没有)** of a plant cover and **susceptible(P264 易得病的，易受影响的；（人）易受感动的，易动感情的)** to wind and water erosion.

导致沙漠化的主要因素有四个：过度种植，过度放牧，过分砍伐，过度灌溉。由于人口密度增加，人们对粮食作物的种植已经扩展到日益干燥的区域进行。这些区域很有可能经常会发生干旱，所以农作物种植失败是很正常的事情。大多数农作物的种植需要事先移除天然植被，而农作物欠收后又会留下大面积荒地，非常容易被风力和雨水侵蚀。

The raising of livestock is a major economic activity in semiarid lands, where grasses are generally the dominant type of natural vegetation. The consequences of an excessive number of livestock grazing in an area are the reduction of the vegetation cover and the **trampling（P422 踩，践踏；伤害，侵犯；脚步沉重地走）** and **pulverization( 粉碎；研碎；彻底摧毁)** of the soil. This is usually followed by the drying of the soil and accelerated erosion.

在半干旱地区，草坪是主要的天然植被，家畜饲养是当地的一项主要经济活动。在一个地区过量饲养家畜会导致植被覆盖面积减少，土地被大量践踏和碾碎。通常，随之而来的就是土地硬化和加速侵蚀。

Firewood is the chief fuel used for cooking and heating in many countries. The increased pressures of expanding populations have led to the removal of woody plants so that many cities and towns are surrounded by large areas completely lacking in trees and **shrubs(P267 灌木；（尤指掺朗姆酒或白兰地的）果汁甜酒；<美>果汁露酒)**. The increasing use of dried animal waste as a substitute fuel has also hurt the soil because this valuable soil conditioner and source of plant nutrients is no longer being returned to the land.

在很多国家木材是用来做饭和加热的最主要燃料。人口增加带来的压力促使人们大量砍伐木材，导致许多城市和乡村周围大面积树木和灌木减少。同时人们大量使用烘干的动物排泄物作为替代燃料同样对土壤不利，因为这些珍贵的土壤成分调节剂和植物营养资源将不会再回归至土壤当中。

The final major human cause of desertification is soil **salinization(盐化作用，盐碱化)** resulting from overirrigation. Excess water from irrigation sinks down into the water table. If no **drainage(P426 排水系统；排水，排泄；排出的水，污水)** system exists, the water table rises, bringing dissolved salts to the surface. The water evaporates and the salts are left behind, creating a white crustal layer that prevents air and water from reaching the underlying soil.

造成土地沙漠化的最后一个主要人为因素在于人类过度灌溉导致土壤的盐碱化。灌溉多余的水渗透到地下水位。假如没有排水系统的存在，那么地下水位上升，把溶解的盐分带到土壤表面。水分蒸发后，盐分留在了表面，形成白色的地壳层，这一地壳层阻止了空气和水接触地底下的土壤。

The extreme **seriousness** of desertification results from the vast areas of land and the tremendous numbers of people affected, as well as from the great difficulty of reversing or even slowing the process. Once the soil has been removed by erosion, only the passage of centuries or millennia will enable new soil to form. In areas where considerable soil still remains, though, a **rigorously(P74 严厉地；残酷地)** enforced program of land protection and cover-crop planting may make it possible to reverse the present deterioration of the surface.

沙漠化问题异常严重，这是因为有佷广阔的地区和数量庞大的人群都受到了沙漠化的影响，而且要想逆转沙漠化的进程甚至减缓沙漠化的速度都面临着巨大的困难。一旦土壤被侵蚀，需要再经过几百到上千年的时间才会产生新的土壤。那些大量土壤仍保存完好的地方，亟需一个严谨而有力的保护政策和植被覆盖计划来保护现有土地。

### Architecture

Architecture is the art and science of designing structures that organize and enclose space for practical and symbolic purposes. Because architecture grows out of human needs and **aspirations(渴望，抱负，志向；送气音；吸引术，抽吸)**, it clearly communicates cultural values. Of all the visual arts, architecture affects our lives most directly for it determines the character of the human environment in major ways.

建筑是一门出于实用和象征的双重目的，通过组织和利用空间来实现设计结构的艺术和科学。。因为建筑源于人类的需求和愿望，同样也可以清楚地传达文化价值。在所有的视觉艺术中，建筑最直接地影响了我们的生活，因为它在很多方面决定了我们生存的环境特征。

Architecture is a three-dimensional form.It utilizes space, mass, **texture（P445 质地，纹理；口感；（音乐或文学的）谐和统一感，神韵）**, line, light, and color. To be architecture, a building must achieve a working harmony with a variety of elements. Humans instinctively seek structures that will shelter and enhance their way of life. It is the work of architects to create buildings that are not simply constructions but also offer inspiration and delight. Buildings contribute to human life when they provide shelter, enrich space, complement their site, suit the climate, and are economically **feasible(P263 可行的，办得到的；很可能会发生的)**. The client who pays for the building and defines its function is an important member of the architectural team. The mediocre design of many contemporary buildings can be traced to both clients and architects.

建筑是一种利用空间、质量、纹理、线条、光线和颜色的三维立体形式。一幢建筑物必须实现各种要素的和谐搭配。人类本能地希望可以提供居住并且改善他们生活质量的建筑。建筑师们创造出来的建筑物不单纯的是建筑物，还为人们带来了灵感和喜悦。建筑物为人类的生活提供了遮蔽处和丰富的空间、增加人们的活动场所、完善人们的居所、帮助人们适应气候的变化，同时在经济上也可承受。建筑团队中，最重要的是那些为建筑支付建设费用并且设计其功能的人，许多当代建筑平庸的根源在于客户和建筑师双反。

In order for the structure to achieve the size and strength necessary to meet its purpose, architecture employs methods of support that, because they are based on physical laws, have changed little since people first discovered them–even while building materials have changed dramatically. The world's architectural structures have also been **devised（P311 设计，发明；<法律>（通过遗嘱）遗赠（不动产）；<古>图谋）** in relation to the objective limitations of materials. Structures can be analyzed in terms of how they deal with **downward(向下的，下降的)** forces created by gravity. They are designed to withstand the forces of compression (pushing together), tension (pulling apart), bending, or a combination of these in different parts of the structure.

为了达到建筑的目的，一定的大小和强度是必须的。尽管建筑材料已经发生了翻天覆地的变化，建筑采用的各种支撑方法自从人们发现它们以来鲜有改变，因为这些方法都建立在物理定律的基础上。世界的建筑结构也因为克服材料限制的目的而发展起来。建筑师们在设计建筑结构的时候需要将重力对材料的影响考虑在内，通过结构设计使建筑不同部分能抵抗压力、拉力、弯曲力或混合的压力。

Every development in architecture has been the result of major technological changes. Materials and methods of construction are integral parts of the design of architectural structures. In earlier times it was necessary to design structural systems suitable for the materials that were available, such as wood, stone, or brick. Today technology has progressed to the point where it is possible to invent new building materials to suit the type of structure desired. Enormous changes in materials and techniques of construction within the last few generations have made it possible to enclose space with much greater ease and speed and with a minimum of material. Progress in this area can be measured by the difference in weight between buildings built now and those of comparable size built one hundred years ago.

甚至建筑的发展也是由重大的技术变革造成的。材料和建设方法是建筑结构设计整体的组成部分。早期，人们必须设计结构系统来配合当前可用的材料，如木头、石头和砖。现今的技术已经发展到能够创造新的建筑材料来适应想要应用的建筑结构。近几代建筑材料和科技的巨大变化使得包围空间更加简单、快速，并且用更少的材料。在这一领域的进步可以用现在修建的建筑和100年前建造的同规模建筑之间的重量差异来衡量。

Modern architectural forms generally have three separate components comparable to elements of the human body: a supporting skeleton or frame, an outer skin enclosing the interior spaces, and equipment, similar to the body's vital organs and systems. The equipment includes **plumbing(（建筑物的）管路系统，管道设备；管道工程，管子工的工作；<非正式>体内“管道”，排泄系统)**, electrical wiring, hot water, and air-conditioning. Of course in early architecture–such as igloos(（尤指北美北部因纽特人用坚厚雪块盖的）圆顶小屋) and adobe structures–there was no such equipment, and the skeleton and skin were often one.

类似人类的身体结构，现代建筑可以划分为三个独立的部分：支撑骨架或框架、围住内部空间的外壳以及像人体内器官一样重要的设施。这些设施包括管道、电线、热水和空调。当然，在早期的圆顶建筑和土坯建筑中并没有这样的设施，皮肤和骨骼也往往是合在一起的。

Much of the world's great architecture has been constructed of stone because of its beauty, permanence, and availability. In the past, whole cities grew from the **arduous(P401 艰辛的，困难的)** task of cutting and piling(地桩；打桩；桩材；打桩工程) stone upon stone. Some of the world's finest stone architecture can be seen in the ruins of the ancient Inca city of Machu Picchu high in the eastern Andes Mountains of Peru. The **doorways** and windows are made possible by placing over the open spaces thick stone beams that support the weight from above. A structural invention had to be made before the physical limitations of stone could be overcome and new architectural forms could be created. That invention was the arch, a curved structure originally made of separate stone or brick segments. The arch was used by the early cultures of the Mediterranean area chiefly for underground drains, but it was the Romans who first developed and used the arch extensively in aboveground structures. Roman builders perfected the semicircular arch made of separate blocks of stone. As a method of spanning space, the arch can support greater weight than a horizontal beam. It works in **compression(P188 压紧，压缩)** to divert the weight above it out to the sides, where the weight is borne by the vertical elements on either side of the arch. The arch is among the many important structural breakthroughs that have characterized architecture throughout the centuries.

世界上大多数伟大的建筑都是石料建筑，因为石料建筑不仅外形漂亮、持久耐用，而且石头随处可得。在过去，整个城市的建筑物都是从艰苦的石块切割和堆砌发展起来的。在秘鲁安第斯山脉东部的马丘比丘印加古城遗址，可以看到世界上最棒的石质建筑。在开阔的空间上放置厚石板来支撑上面的石头，使门和窗的修建成为可能。设计师们必须在克服石头的物理限制以及新建筑形式发展之前发明出建筑结构，这就是拱形结构，即最初由分段的石头或砖块构成的弧形结构。拱最初在地中海早期文化中用来建设地下水渠，但古罗马人最先开发和广泛的利用它作为地上建筑的结构，他们完善了由分段的石块组成的半圆形拱。作为跨越空间的一种方式，拱可以比水平横梁支撑更大的重量。它使得其上的压力转移到两侧，由两侧垂直的部分来承担压力。拱形结构只是近百年来众多重要建筑结构的突破之一。

**A. Architects seek to create buildings that are both visually appealing and well suited for human use.**

**B. Over the course of the history of building, innovations in material and methods of construction have given architects ever greater freedom to express themselves.**

C. Throughout history buildings have been constructed like human bodies, needing distinct “organ” systems in order to function.

D. Both clients and architects are responsible for the **mediocre(平庸的，中等（质量）的)** designs of some modern buildings.

E. Modern buildings tend to lack the beauty of ancient stone buildings such as those of Machu Picchu.

**F. <u>The discovery and use of the arch typifies the way in which architecture advances by developing more efficient types of structures.**</u>

“拱门的发现与使用是建筑进步的一种典型体现，建筑正是通过不断开发出更高效的结构来不断取得进步

Which of the following correctly characterizes the relationship between the human body and architecture that is described in paragraph 5?

A. Complex equipment inside buildings is **the one** element in modern architecture that resembles a component of the human body.

B. The components in early buildings were similar to three particular elements of the human body.

C. Modern buildings have components that are as likely to change as the human body is.

**D. In general, modern buildings more closely resemble the human body than earlier buildings do.**

<u>However, some modern architectural designs, such as those using **folded** **plates** of **concreter** or air-inflated structures, are again **unifying(（使）联合，（使）统一；使协调)** skeleton and skin.</u>





### Depletion of the Ogallala Aquifer

The vast grasslands of the High Plains in the central United States were settled by farmers and ranchers in the 1880s. This region has a **semiarid(半干旱的)** climate, and for 50 years after its settlement, it supported a low-**intensity（P168 强烈，剧烈；（光、声音等的）强度 密度）** agricultural economy of cattle ranching and wheat farming. In the early twentieth century, however, it was discovered that much of the High Plains was **underlain（在……的下面（underlie 的过去分词））** by a huge aquifer (a rock layer containing large quantities of groundwater). This aquifer was named the Ogallala aquifer after the Ogallala Sioux Indians, who once inhabited the region.

19世纪80年代，在美国中部北美大平原的广阔草原上定居着农场主们和牧场主们。这里有着半干旱的气候，在人们定居50年后，它支撑了一个以畜牧业和小麦种植为主的低密度农业经济。然而，在20世纪初，人们发现北美大平原的大部地下是巨大的蓄水层（含有大量地下水的岩层）。这个蓄水层因曾经在这里定居过的奥加拉拉苏族印第安人而得名，被称作奥加拉拉蓄水层。

The Ogallala aquifer is a sandstone formation that underlies some 583,000 square kilometers of land extending from northwestern Texas to southern South Dakota. Water from rains and melting snows has been accumulating in the Ogallala for the past 30,000 years. Estimates indicate that the aquifer contains enough water to fill Lake Huron, but unfortunately, under the semiarid climatic conditions that presently exist in the region, rates of addition to the aquifer are minimal, amounting to about half a centimeter a year.

奥加拉拉蓄水层属于砂岩结构，在从德克萨斯州西北到南达科塔州南部的地下绵延了58.3万平方公里。雨水和融雪自3万年前便开始在奥加拉拉蓄积。据估计，奥加拉拉蓄水层的含水量足以填满休伦湖，但不幸的是，在目前该地区半干旱的气候条件下，奥加拉拉蓄水层的蓄水能力极低，每年仅半厘米左右。

The first wells were **drilled（P201 钻，钻机；训练，演习；粗斜纹布；条播沟；条播机；条播作物；<非正式>常规，正确步骤；尾角螺）** into the Ogallala during the drought years of the early 1930s. The ensuing rapid expansion of irrigation agriculture, especially from the 1950s **onward(  向前；从……以后；取得进步，获得成功)**, transformed the economy of the region. More than 100,000 wells now **tap** the Ogallala. Modern irrigation devices, each capable of **spraying（P132 喷，喷洒（液体）；（使）飞溅，）** 4.5 million liters of water a day, have produced a landscape dominated by geometric patterns of circular green islands of crops. Ogallala water has enabled the High Plains region to supply significant amounts of the cotton, sorghum, wheat, and corn grown in the United States. In addition, 40 percent of American grain-fed beef cattle are **fattened(使变胖，使长肥：使动植物体重增加，通常为了食用或销售。)** here.

20世纪30年代初，奥加拉拉正处于干旱时期，人们打出了第一口井。灌溉农业的迅速扩张，特别是20世纪50年代之后，改变了这一地区的经济。目前人们已经在奥加拉拉地区共开凿了10万多口井。日喷水量达到450万升的现代灌溉设备，形成了一个圆形绿岛作物为主的景观。奥加拉拉蓄水层支撑了北美大平原地区棉花、高粱、小麦、玉米的灌溉需求。此外，美国40%谷饲养的肉牛在这里被育肥。

This **unprecedented( P9 前所未有的，史无前例的；（大小、数量、程度等）前所未知的，空前的)** development of a **finite(有限的，有限制的；限定的)** groundwater resource with an almost **negligible(P404 微不足道的，不值一提的)** natural recharge rate-that is,virtually no natural water source to **replenish(p492 补充，重新装满；补足（原有的量）)** the water supply-has caused water tables in the region to fall drastically. In the 1930s, wells encountered plentiful water at a depth of about 15 meters; currently, they must be dug to depths of 45 to 60 meters or more. In places, the water table is declining at a rate of a meter a year, necessitating the periodic deepening of wells and the use of ever-more-powerful pumps. It is estimated that at current withdrawal rates, much of the aquifer will run dry within 40 years. The situation is most critical in Texas, where the climate is driest, the greatest amount of water is being pumped, and the aquifer contains the least water. It is projected that the remaining Ogallala water will, by the year 2030, support only 35 to 40 percent of the irrigated **acreage(面积，英亩数)** in Texas that is supported in 1980.

考虑到几乎没有补充率（实质上没有自然水资源进行补充），这种有限地下水资源前所未有的发展已经引起了该地区地下水位的急剧下降。在20世纪30年代，井下15米就有丰富的水资源，而现在，必须挖掘到45米到60米甚至更深的地方才行。有的地方地下水位的下降速度甚至达到了每年1米，迫使人们周期性的加深水井并使用更有力的水泵。按现今的下降速度来估计，大部分地下蓄水将在40年内耗尽。这种现象在气候最干旱的德克萨斯州尤为严重。大量的水被从地下抽起，蓄水层含水量最少。据估计，到2030年，德克萨斯州余下的奥加拉拉含水只能支持1980年灌溉面积的35%到40%。

The reaction of farmers to the inevitable **depletion(P79 损耗，耗尽)** of the Ogallala varies. Many have been attempting to conserve water by irrigating less frequently or by switching to crops that require less water. Others, however, have adopted the philosophy that it is best to use the water while it is still economically profitable to do so and to concentrate on high-value crops such as cotton. The incentive of the farmers who wish to conserve water is reduced by their knowledge that many of their neighbors are profiting by using great amounts of water, and in the process are drawing down the entire region's water supplies. 

农场主们对无法避免的奥加拉拉蓄水层枯竭的反应各不相同。很多人已经开始尝试通过降低灌溉频率或者改种需水较少的庄稼来节约水资源。而另外一些人却抱着趁水资源还能产生经济效益就应抓紧利用的想法，继续种植高价值的棉花等农作物。当那些想节水的农场主得知邻居们通过大量耗水的种植而盈利的时候，他们的热情降低了，从而导致了整个区域的供水量的减少。

In the face of the upcoming water supply crisis, a number of **grandiose(宏伟的；堂皇的；浮夸的；宏大的)** schemes have been developed to transport vast quantities of water by canal or pipeline from the Mississippi, the Missouri, or the Arkansas rivers. Unfortunately, the cost of water obtained through any of these schemes would increase pumping costs at least tenfold, making the cost of irrigated agricultural products from the region uncompetitive on the national and international markets. Somewhat more promising have been recent experiments for releasing **capillary(P482 毛细血管；毛细管)** water (water in the soil) above the water table by injecting compressed air into the ground. Even if this process proves successful, however, it would almost triple water costs. Genetic engineering also may provide a partial solution, as <u>new strains(品种) of</u> drought-resistant crops continue to be developed. <u>Whatever the final answer to the water crisis may be, it is evident that within the High Plains, irrigation water will never again be the abundant, inexpensive resource it was | during the agricultural boom years of the mid-twentieth century.</u>

在即将到来的水资源供应危机面前，人们提出了一些宏伟的供水计划，比如将密西西比河、密苏里河或者阿肯色河的水通过运河或管道运到需要用水的地方。不幸的是，通过以上任何一种方式获得水资源都会将抽水的成本提高10倍以上，进而导致这一地区的灌溉农产品成本在国内和国际市场上失去竞争力。最近一些有希望获得成功的试验试图通过向土壤中注入压力，释放水层上方土壤中的毛细管水。即使这样行之有效，抽水成本会变到原来的3倍。基因工程也会通过继续研发抗旱作物新品种，帮助解决部分难题。无论这次水资源危机的最终结果如何，显然，北美大平原地区灌溉水资源再也不会像20世纪中期农业繁荣时期的那样充足并且廉价了。

 

### Deer Populations of the Puget Sound

Two species of deer have been prevalent in the Puget Sound area of Washington State in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. The black-tailed deer, a lowland, west-side cousin of the **mule(杂交动物，杂交植物；)** deer of eastern Washington, is now the most common. The other species, the Columbian white-tailed deer, in earlier times was common in the open **prairie(P377 大草原)** country; it is now restricted to the low, **marshy(p40 沼泽的)** islands and flood plains along the lower Columbia River.

在太平洋西北区的美国华盛顿州，有两种鹿在普吉特海湾非常普遍。最常见的黑尾鹿是华盛顿东部杂交鹿在西部的表亲，它们生活在低地。另一种哥伦比亚白尾鹿，从前在开阔的草原上很常见，而现在只能在低矮的沼泽岛屿地带和哥伦比亚河下游的河滩地区才能看到它们。

Nearly any kind of plant of the forest **understory(*n.*林下叶层；下层植被)** can be part of a deer's diet. Where the forest inhibits the growth of grass and other **meadow** plants, the black-tailed deer browses on huckleberry, salal, dogwood, and almost any other **shrub(P267 灌木丛)** or herb. But this is fair-weather feeding. What keeps the black-tailed deer alive in the **harsher(P468 严厉的（harsh 的比较级）)** seasons of plant **decay(P97（建筑、地方等）破败，衰落；（观念、影响力等）衰败；（使）腐朽，腐烂)** and **dormancy(P178 [生物] 休眠，冬眠；[生物] 蛰伏)**? One **compensation** for not hibernating is the built-in urge to migrate. Deer may move from high-**elevation** **browse(随意的看，浏览；（动物吃的）植物 )** areas in summer down to the lowland areas in late fall. Even with snow on the ground, the high bushy understory is exposed; also snow and wind bring down **leafy(（植物）多叶的；长满树木的；（植物）阔叶的；叶状的；由树木构成的)** branches of cedar, hemlock, red alder, and other **arboreal(P140 树木的；栖息在树上的)** **fodder(饲料；素材)**.

森林里，几乎任何植物都是鹿的食物。在森林抑制草和其它草甸植物生长的地方，黑尾鹿可以吃越橘、北美白珠树、山茱萸和其他几乎所有灌木和草；但这些只能在好天气里才能吃得到；在植物衰败、隐匿的严寒季节，黑尾鹿们是如何过冬的呢？避免冬眠的一种方法就是天生的迁徙习性。它们会在夏天迁徙到高海拔觅食区，直到秋天结束再回到低地。即便地面还有残雪，高的灌木也会露出来；风雪天气会把雪松、铁衫、红桤木和其它乔木多叶的树枝带下来。

The numbers of deer have fluctuated markedly since the entry of Europeans into Puget Sound country. <u>The early explorers and settlers told of abundant deer in the early 1800s and yet almost in the same breath **bemoaned(哀叹，悲叹：对某事表示悲痛、遗憾或不满。)** the lack of this **succulent(多汁的；多水分的；多汁性的)** game animal.</u> Famous explorers of the north American frontier, Lewis and Clark arrived at the mouth of the Columbia River on November 14, 1805, in nearly starved circumstances. They had experienced great difficulty finding game west of the Rockies and not until the second of December did they kill their first **elk(驼鹿，麋鹿；美洲赤鹿；驼鹿皮革)**. To keep 40 people alive that winter, they consumed approximately 150 elk and 20 deer. And when game moved out of the lowlands in early spring, the **expedition(P183 探险队)** decided to return east rather than face possible starvation. Later on in the early years of the nineteenth century, when Fort Vancouver became the headquarters of the Hudson's Bay Company, deer populations continued to fluctuate. David Douglas, Scottish botanical explorer of the 1830s, found a disturbing change in the animal life around the fort during the period between his first visit in 1825 and his final contact with the fort in 1832. A recent Douglas biographer states:" The deer which once **picturesquely(P282 如画地，别致地；生动地)** dotted the **meadows(草地，牧场；河边低洼地)** around the fort were gone ?in 1832?, hunted to **extermination( 消灭；根绝)** in order to protect the crops."

自从欧洲人进入了普吉特海湾，鹿群的数量发生了显著的变化。<u>早期的探险家和殖民者说起在19世纪早期那儿有大量的鹿群，与此同时惋惜现在这种诱人动物的稀少</u>。著名的北美探险先驱者刘易斯和克拉克在落基山西部经历种种困难，并且直到第二年12月他们才杀死了第一只麋鹿。为了让40人在冬天里存活，他们消耗了150只麋鹿和20只小鹿。当猎物在早春时期迁徙出了低地，远征队决定返回东部而不是去面对潜在的饥饿。此后在19世纪最初几年里，温哥华堡成为哈德逊湾公司的总部，鹿的数量持续波动。19世纪30年代，苏格兰植物学探险家大卫•道格拉斯发现了他在1825年第一次的探访和1832年的最后接触之间出现在温哥华堡附近令人不安的变化。在道格拉斯近期的传记中陈述到：在1832年曾经如画般点缀在温哥华堡附近草地上的鹿群已经消失了，为了保护农作物猎杀致灭绝。

Reduction in numbers of game should have <u>**boded(P25 预示；为……的兆头)** ill for</u> their survival in later times. A worsening of the **plight(P498  困境)** of deer was to be expected as settlers **encroached(P346 逐步侵占（侵犯），蚕食；侵占（土地）)** on the land, logging, burning, and clearing, eventually replacing a wilderness landscape with roads, cities, towns, and factories. No doubt the numbers of deer declined still further. Recall the fate of the Columbian white-tailed deer, now in a protected status. But for the black-tailed deer, human pressure has had just the opposite effect. Wildlife zoologist Helmut Buechner(1953), in reviewing the nature of biotic changes in Washington through recorded time, says that "since the early 1940s, the state has had more deer than at any other time in its history, the winter population fluctuating around approximately 320,000 deer (mule and black-tailed deer), which will **yield(P355 产生（收益、效益等），产生（结果）；出产（天然产品，农产品，工业产品）；屈服，让步；)** about 65,000 of either sex and any age annually for an **indefinite** period."

鹿群数量的减少预示了它们今后生存的艰辛。当殖民者入侵它们的领地时，人类在它们生活的土地上进行采伐、焚烧，清除障碍，最终将公路、城市、城镇和工厂代替了荒野风景。毋庸置疑，鹿群的数量进一步减少。回想起来，哥伦比亚白尾鹿的命运，现在已经处于被保护地位。而对黑尾鹿来说，人类的压力反而产生了相反的效果。野生动物学家赫尔穆特•布希纳（1953）通过已有记录评论了华盛顿地区生物的自然变化，他说：“20世纪40年代早期，美国拥有比以往任何历史时期都多的鹿群，鹿群冬季的数量在接近32万只鹿（杂交和黑尾鹿）左右波动，在此之后的每一年不同年龄段的公鹿和母鹿数量分别会增加至65 000只。

The causes of this population rebound are consequences of other human actions. First, the major predators of deer-wolves, cougar, and lynx-have been greatly reduced in numbers. Second, conservation has been **insured** by limiting times for and types of hunting. But the most **profound** reason for the **restoration** of high population numbers has been the fate of the forests. Great tracts of lowland country deforested by logging, fire, or both have become ideal feeding grounds of deer. <u>In addition to finding an increase of suitable browse, like huckleberry and vine maple, Arthur Einarsen, longtime game biologist in the Pacific Northwest, found quality of browse in the open areas to be substantially more nutritive.</u> The protein content of shade-grown vegetation, for example, was much lower than that for plants grown in clearings.

这种鹿群数量的反弹是由于人类其他活动造成。首先，狼、美洲豹和山猫等鹿群的主要猎食者急剧减少。其次，通过限制捕猎时间和捕猎种类来保护鹿群。但鹿群数量恢复的主要原因在于森林减少。大部分的低地的树木被砍伐、焚烧，进而成为了鹿群理想的生活场地。以便他们去寻找更适合的嫩叶，比如越橘类和枫叶。太平洋西北的生物学家亚瑟•埃纳森还发现在空旷地区的高质量的嫩叶大部分都是很有营养的，就像在遮蔽中生长的植物，他们所包含的蛋白质比那些在空旷地区生长的植物的蛋白质低得多。

### Cave Art in Europe

The earliest discovered traces of art are **beads(（有孔的）珠子；（液体的）小滴)** and carvings, and then paintings, from sites dating back to the Upper Paleolithic period. We might expect that early artistic **efforts(成就)** would be **crude(P35 粗略的，大概的；粗糙的，粗制的；冒犯的，粗俗的；天然的，自然的 )**, but the cave paintings of Spain and southern France show a marked degree of skill. So do the naturalistic paintings on **slabs(厚板)** of stone **excavated(P213  发掘，挖掘（古物）；挖（洞），开凿)** in southern Africa. Some of those slabs appear to have been painted as much as 28,000 years ago, which suggests that painting in Africa is as old as painting in Europe. But painting may be even older than that. The early Australians may have painted on the walls of rock shelters and <u>**cliff(P257 悬崖，峭壁)** faces(悬崖峭壁)</u> at least 30,000 years ago, and maybe as much as 60,000 years ago.

迄今为止，发现的最早的并且有迹可寻的工艺品是珠链和雕刻，然后还有绘画，人类在旧石器时代晚期的遗址上发现了它们。虽然我们可能会认为早期的艺术成就都是不成熟的，但西班牙与法国南部的岩洞画显示出了高超的技艺，在非洲南部发掘出的自然石板画也是如此。其中的一些石板画看上去像是在28 000年前画出的，这表明非洲绘画与欧洲绘画一样时间久远，但可能更早些。至少30 000年前，也可能追溯至60 000年前，早期澳大利亚人就已经在岩石遮蔽的墙上和悬崖断面上作画了。

The researchers Peter Ucko and Andree Rosenfeld identified three principal locations of paintings in the caves of western Europe: (1) in obviously inhabited rock shelters and cave entrances; (2) in galleries immediately off the inhabited areas of caves; and (3) in the inner reaches of caves, whose difficulty of access has been interpreted by some as a sign that magical-religious activities were performed there.

研究人员彼特•阿寇 和安德烈•罗森菲尔德指出西欧洞画的三个主要地点：（1）在明显有遮蔽可供人类居住的岩石和洞穴入口处，（2）在居住的洞穴一出门的走廊上，（3）在洞穴所能及的最深处，有人认为之所以在最深处作画是因为当时的人们曾在这里进行神秘的宗教活动。

The subjects of the paintings are mostly animals. The paintings rest on bare walls, with no **backdrops(背景布幕；背景幕)** or environmental **trappings(服饰，礼服；外部标志；马饰)**. "Perhaps, like many contemporary peoples, Upper Paleolithic men and women believed that the drawing of a human image could cause death or injury, and if that were indeed their belief, it might explain why human figures are rarely depicted in cave art. " Another explanation for the focus on animals might be that these people **sought(寻找（seek 的过去式和过去分词）)** to improve their luck at hunting. This theory is suggested by evidence of chips in the painted figures, perhaps made by spears thrown at the drawings. But if improving their hunting luck was the chief motivation for the paintings, it is difficult to explain why only a few show signs of having been speared. Perhaps the paintings were inspired by the need to increase the supply of animals. Cave art seems to have reached a peak toward the end of the Upper Paleolithic period, when the **<u>herds(P352  兽群，畜群；人群，民众)** of(成群的)</u> game**(herds of game 猎物数量)** were decreasing.

这些绘画的主题大部分都是动物。这些画画在裸露的岩石上，没有任何背景和环境装饰。或许，同许多当代人一样，后石器时代的人们也相信画人物像会引起伤害或死亡。如果这确实是他们的信念，那就解释了为什么在洞穴绘画中很少描绘人物。对于画中以动物题材为主的另一个解释是，人们在探索如何提高打猎的命中率。墙上所画的动物身上有一些伤口，很可能是原始人向它们扔矛时留下的，这个证据也证实了以上判断。但如果提高打猎命中率真的是岩壁画的主要动机，那么就很难解释为什么只有少数画上有被矛戳过的痕迹。或许是出于增加猎物的需求而画的画。在后期旧石器时代猎群数量减少时，岩洞画艺术似乎达到了顶峰。

<u>The particular symbolic significance of the cave paintings in southwestern France is more **explicitly(P484 清楚明白的，明确的，详述的；直截了当的，坦率的；赤裸裸表现性爱（或暴力）的，露骨的)** revealed, perhaps, by the results of a study conducted by researchers Patricia Rice and Ann Paterson.</u> The data they present suggest that the animals **portrayed(P466 描绘，描写；（在艺术或文学作品中）描述，刻画)** in the cave paintings were mostly the ones that the painters preferred for meat and for materials such as **hides(P29 躲藏,兽皮)**. For example, wild cattle (bovines) and horses are portrayed more often than we would expect by chance, probably because they were larger and heavier (meatier) than other animals in the environment. In addition, the paintings mostly portray animals that the painters may have feared the most because of their size, speed, natural weapons such as **tusks(长牙；尖头，尖形物)** and horns, and the unpredictability of their behavior. That is, mammoths, bovines, and horses are portrayed more often than deer and reindeer. Thus, the paintings are consistent with the idea that the art is related to the importance of hunting in the economy of Upper Paleolithic people. Consistent with this idea, according to the investigators, is the fact that the art of the cultural period that followed the Upper Paleolithic also seems to reflect how people got their food. But in that period, when getting food no longer depended on hunting large game animals (because they were becoming extinct), the art **ceased(P219 终止，结束)** to focus on portrayals of animals.

也许研究者帕特丽夏•赖斯和安•派特森所做研究的结果更清楚地揭示了法国西南部的岩洞画的特殊象征性意义。研究显示，绘画者喜欢食用的动物或喜欢用作兽皮的动物是岩洞画中经常被描绘的动物。比如，野牛（牛）和马的出现比我们预料的更为频繁，可能因为它们比其它动物更大更沉（肉更多）。另外，画作中主要描绘了绘画者害怕的动物，它们的体形、速度、与生俱来的武器如长牙和角，以及它们行为的不可预知性都令绘画者感到恐惧。于是，和鹿、驯鹿相比，猛犸、牛和马会更经常画在墙上。因此，在旧石器时代晚期的人的经济中，岩洞艺术与打猎的重要性有关，这些画作也与这个观点相符合。看起来旧石器时代晚期的文化期的艺术也反映了人们如何得到食物，根据调查者的研究，这一事实也与前文的想法一致。但在那个时期，当不再依靠猎取大型猎物获得食物时（因为它们开始变得稀少），岩洞艺术便不再以描绘动物为主了。

Upper Paleolithic art was not **confined( 限制，局限；防止……扩散；关押，监禁)** to cave paintings. Many **shafts(杆，柄；（机器的）轴；（马车的）辕；箭，矛；)** of spears and similar objects were decorated with figures of animals. The anthropologist Alexander Marshack has an interesting interpretation of some of the engravings made during the Upper Paleolithic. He believes that as far back as 30,000 B.C., hunters may have used a system of **notation(P258 （音乐、数学等的）标记系统，成套符号，标记法)**, engraved on bone and stone, to mark **phases(P365 阶段，时期  （月亮的）位相)** of the Moon. If this is true, it would mean that Upper Paleolithic people were capable of complex thought and were consciously aware of their environment. In addition to other artworks, **figurines(小雕像，小塑像)** representing the human female in **exaggerated(P406 夸张的，夸大的，言过其实的；)** form have also been found at Upper Paleolithic sites. It has been suggested that these figurines were an ideal type or an expression of a desire for fertility.

旧石器时代晚期的艺术不仅仅局限于洞穴绘画。许多矛杆和类似的东西上都画了动物作为装饰。人类学家亚历山大•马斯哈克对旧石器时代晚期的一些雕刻品有一个有趣的解释。他认为在公元前30 000年，猎人们可能使用了一种刻在骨头或石头上的标志法来标记不同的月相。如果此论述是真的，这就意味着旧石器时代晚期的人们已经有了复杂的思维并对他们的环境有了一个理性的认识。人们还在旧石器时代晚期的遗址上发现了以夸张的形式描绘妇女的小雕塑。这也暗示了这些小雕塑是一种理想形象或者说表达了当时的人类期望多生育的愿望。


### American Railroads
在美国，铁路引领了交通革命的第二阶段，超越了先前运河的重要性。19世纪中期，美国铁路经历了大规模扩张。密西西比河以东的主要城市被一张铁路网络连接起来。芝加哥的增长体现了这些铁路链接的影响。1849年，芝加哥只是一个人口不到几百人的小村庄，几乎没有铁路服务。到1860年，它已成为一个拥有10万人口的城市，拥有11条铁路。芝加哥以北和西部的农民不再需要通过密西西比河将粮食、家畜和乳制品运往新奥尔良；他们现在可以直接将产品运往东部。芝加哥取代了新奥尔良，成为美国内陆的主要商业中心。

In the United States, railroads **spearheaded** the second phase of the transportation revolution by overtaking the previous importance of canals. The mid-1800s saw a great expansion of American railroads. The major cities east of the Mississippi River were linked by a spiderweb of railroad tracks. Chicago’s growth illustrates the impact of these rail links. In 1849 Chicago was a village of a few hundred people with virtually no rail service. By 1860 it had become a city of 100,000, **served** by eleven railroads. Farmers to the north and west of Chicago no longer had to ship their grain, livestock, and dairy products down the Mississippi River to New Orleans; they could now ship their products directly east. Chicago supplanted New Orleans as the interior of America’s main commercial hub.

东西铁路线路促进了中西部的定居和农业发展。到1860年，伊利诺伊州、印第安纳州和威斯康星州取代了俄亥俄州、宾夕法尼亚州和纽约州，成为领先的小麦种植州。铁路使农民能够将产品快速运送到东部，增加了农田的价值，并促进了更多的定居。反过来，农业地区的人口增长推动了芝加哥、达文波特（爱荷华州）和明尼阿波利斯等城市的工业发展，因为新定居者需要木材建造围栏和房屋，并需要磨坊将小麦磨成面粉。

The east-west rail lines stimulated the settlement and agricultural development of the Midwest. By 1860 Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin had replaced Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York as the leading wheat-growing states. Enabling farmers to speed their products to the East, railroads increased the value of farmland and promoted additional settlement. In turn, population growth in agricultural areas triggered industrial development in cities such as Chicago, Davenport (Iowa), and Minneapolis, for the new settlers needed lumber for **fences** and houses and mills to grind wheat into flour.

铁路还推动了沿途小镇的发展。伊利诺伊中央铁路在1855年拥有比任何其他铁路更多的轨道，不仅通过运输获利，还通过房地产投机赚取利润。伊利诺伊中央铁路购买了沿途车站的土地，并在车站周围规划了城镇。例如，伊利诺伊州曼特诺被选为伊利诺伊中央铁路的停靠点，将原本没有一栋房子的十字路口在1854年转变为一个近千人口的繁忙小镇，到1860年，那里有酒店、木材厂、粮仓和面粉厂。到南北战争（1861-1865）时，很少有人认为铁路连接的中西部仍然是一个边远地区，或将其居民视为拓荒者。

Railroads also propelled the growth of small towns along their routes. The Illinois Central Railroad, which had more track than any other railroad in 1855, made money not only from its traffic but also from real estate speculation. Purchasing land for stations along its path, the Illinois Central then laid out towns around the stations. The selection of Manteno, Illinois, as a stop of the Illinois Central, for example, transformed the site from a crossroads without a single house in 1854 into a bustling town of nearly a thousand in 1860, replete with hotels, lumberyards, grain elevators, and gristmills. By the Civil War (1861–1865), few thought of the railroad-linked Midwest as a frontier region or viewed its inhabitants as pioneers.

作为美国的第一大企业，铁路改变了商业的运作方式。在1830年代初期，铁路像运河一样，依赖州政府的财政援助。然而，随着1830年代末经济衰退的到来，州政府放弃了过于雄心勃勃的铁路项目。选民们认为铁路让他们承担了高额税收并摧毁了希望，因此反对州政府的援助，到了1840年代初期，几个州修改了宪法，禁止为铁路和运河提供州资助。联邦政府承担了一部分财政压力，但在1860年前，联邦援助并没有为铁路提供重要的刺激。相反，财政负担部分转移到了那些希望吸引铁路的农业地区的市政府和县政府。这些市政府，例如，通常会给铁路提供通行权、车站用地的土地赠与以及公共资金。

As the nation’s first big business, the railroads transformed the conduct of business. During the early 1830s, railroads, like canals, depended on financial aid from state governments. With the onset of economic depression in the late 1830s, however, state governments scrapped overly ambitious railroad projects. Convinced that railroads burdened them with high taxes and blasted hopes, voters turned against state aid, and in the early 1840s, several states amended their constitutions to bar state funding for railroads and canals. The federal government took up some of the slack, but federal aid did not provide a major stimulus to railroads before 1860. Rather, part of the burden of finance passed to city and county governments in agricultural areas that wanted to attract railroads. Such municipal governments, for example, often gave railroads rights-of-way, grants of land for stations, and public funds.

然而，1850年代铁路网络的迅速扩展使地方政府的融资能力受到了挑战，迫使它们转向私人投资，这种投资从未完全缺席。居住在铁路附近的居民早就意识到铁路的经济利益，他们长期以来一直购买由政府发行的铁路股票，并直接购买铁路股票，通常通过为修建铁路贡献劳动力来支付。但1850年代的大型铁路需要比这些小投资者能够产生的资本更多的资金。逐渐地，铁路融资的中心转移到了纽约市，实际上，正是1850年代的铁路繁荣帮助将纽约市的华尔街打造成了美国最大的资本市场。所有主要铁路的股票都在1850年代的纽约证券交易所交易。此外，铁路的增长使纽约市成为现代投资公司的中心。投资公司评估了较小美国城市中铁路的股票，并将这些股票的购买者寻找到了纽约市、费城、巴黎、伦敦、阿姆斯特丹和汉堡。控制资金流向铁路后，投资银行家开始通过在铁路遇到问题时监督行政重组，逐渐对铁路的内部事务施加了影响。

The dramatic expansion of the railroad network in the 1850s, however, strained the financing capacity of local governments and required a turn toward private investment, which had never been absent from the picture. Well aware of the economic benefits of railroads, individuals living near them had long purchased railroad stock issued by governments and had directly bought stock in railroads, often paying by contributing their labor to building the railroads. But the large railroads of the 1850s needed more capital than such small investors could generate. Gradually, the center of railroad financing shifted to New York City, and in fact, it was the railroad boom of the 1850s that helped make Wall Street in New York City the nation’s greatest capital market. The stocks of all the leading railroads were traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during the 1850s. In addition, the growth of railroads turned New York City into the center of modern investment firms. The investment firms evaluated the stock of railroads in the smaller American cities and then found purchasers for these stocks in New York City, Philadelphia, Paris, London, Amsterdam, and Hamburg. Controlling the flow of funds to railroads, the investment bankers began to exert influence over the railroads’ internal affairs by supervising administrative reorganizations in times of trouble.
