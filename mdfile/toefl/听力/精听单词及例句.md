## Set1

have you checked to see if your professor put any materials for you to look at **on reserve**

你有没有检查看教授是否给你预留了学习资料？

## Set2 

It's an outdoor scene, an everyday scene, it's kind of **bleak(*adj.*不乐观的，无望的；无遮掩的，荒凉的；)**, but you can really see those **broad** **brushstrokes(*n.*一笔；笔的一划；绘画技巧)**, and the **blurry(*adj.*模糊不清的)** lines.

这是一个户外场景，日常生活场景，它（看上去）有点凄凉，看着这些粗大、模糊的线条

And the Sales Barn, it was basically this place where the local farmers bought and sold their **cattle**, their farm animals.

Sales Barn 基本上是当地农民买卖牲畜、家畜的地方。

Good. One other painting I really want you to look at is of a young woman surrounded by **pumpkins**.You will notice that the woman's face is so realistic looking that it's almost like a photograph.The woman's nose is a little less than perfect and her hair is kind of messed up—This is realism.But then, the background of the painting—this woman with the pumpkins is wrapped in a blanket of broad thick brushstrokes, and—it's all kinds of **zigzagging** brushstrokes and lines, kind of chaotic almost when you look at it close.And there are **vibrant** colors—There's lots of orange, with little hints of an **electric blue peeking out**.

很好。我很希望你们看的另外一幅是一个年轻的女子被南瓜环绕的画。你会注意到那女人的脸是如此的逼真，就像是一张照片。这幅画里妇女的鼻子真是太真实了，还有她那乱蓬蓬的头发也是， 这就是写实派。但是，你看这幅画的背景，这个南瓜地里的妇女被一块地毯围着，而这个地毯是用粗犷的线条（broad thick brushstrokes 之前在说印象主义时提到的）所勾画的，并且这些线条都有点锯齿状的，当你近看的时候甚至有点乱乱的。而且有鲜明的色彩—有很多的橙色，摇曳着少量的铁蓝色。

## Set1

**how far along have you gotten**



**I've** got all my data, so I'm starting to summarize it now, preparing graphs and stuff.

很多时候完成时的have都是听不出来和连读的 



That's usually my **rule of thumb**: would my parents understand this?

经验之谈





Right. I understand. I was wondering if I should also include the notes from the research **journal** you **suggested** I keep?

这里journal连读都快变成 journali 了，suggested的 ed音已经消失了

这里的笔记应当是 wonder include notes from research



Yes, definitely. You should use them to indicate what your **evolution in thought was through time**.

这里能够听清的关键词和所需要记的只有 indicate evolution，后面的表达没听过就非常难听出来，而且；还有连音的话就是既听不出来也猜不出来 

OK. So, for example, I studied **meteorological records**; I looked at climate charts; I used different **methods** for analyzing the data, like certain **statistical tests**; and then I discussed the results.

统计检验：一种用于检验统计数据中某种假设是否成立的方法，通常用于评估观察到的数据与预期结果之间的差异是否具有统计学意义。

题目中出现的东西，或者说单词，一般在文章中不知出现一次



Is that what **you mean**?

听成了 we need，这里纯属是自己听少了导致的



Hmm... something just came into my mind **and** went out the other side.

这里的and常常很难听出来，所以我发现了弱读这个东西



Oh, that happens to me a lot, so **I've** come up with a **pretty good** memory management tool.

pretty good 你听到的 **/ˈprɪɾi kən/** 是**连读、弱化、语速**共同作用的结果。简直狗屎，这时候选择直接忽略比较好。所以这里的笔记应该是 teacher 也。 memory management



I carry a little **pad** with me all the time and **jot down** questions or ideas that I don't want to forget.

jot 

- *vt.*略记；摘要记载下来
- *n.*少量；稍许


I carry a little pad with me all the time and jot down questions or ideas that I don't want to forget.



For example, I went to the doctor with my daughter and her **baby son l**ast week and we knew we wouldn't remember everything we wanted to ask the doctor, so we actually made a list of **five things** we wanted **answers to**.

这一段所有单词可以说是完全熟练，甚至听的话也没什么问题，但是有时候会反应不过来，比如baby son，这个是没听过这种表达 five things，太过于客制化以至于不知道到底是什么， answers to 也反应不出来，推测也很难出来，所以我需要做的就是直接总结这句话，make a list。然后推断这个例子的考点是 why 教授会使用这个例子，那么答案就是上一句的 memory management。总结：遇到例子该怎么办：一是可以补充前面没听到的主体，也就是核心内容，可以推测出他在解释什么，二是知道例子可以总结一段内容，而不用听的很清楚



Yes. It **ends up** that I have data on more than just the **immediate** Grant City area, so I also included some regional data in the report.

immediate立刻的，及时的。这里的ends up可以直接忽略不翻译，本以为最终，

这里总结的内容应该是more than  regional  data

## Set5

Why do I value playing music? Well, like most **amateur** musicians, I only play because, well, I just enjoy it. **It's something that's an end in itself.**

我为什么喜欢弹奏音乐？其实，跟绝大多数音乐爱好者一样，我享受弹奏音乐的过程。为弹奏而弹奏。

end in itself 是一个固定表达，表示某事**本身即具有意义**，不需要额外的理由。

Aristotle 亚里士多德

Here he notes, with some **frustration**, people disagree.

这里亚里士多德提到，几经挫折人们往往并不同意刚才的看法。



In the end, Aristotle says that true happiness is the **exercise of reason** - life of **intellectual contemplation**... of thinking.

最后，亚里士多德表示，真正的幸福是理智的践行，即关于知性思考的生活，关于思想的生活。

But…so this biologist is basically claiming that people who like to eat these vegetables actually have some sort of **sensory deficit（赤字，）**?

但是……所以这名生物学家基本上是在说，喜欢吃这些蔬菜的人其实是因为某种感觉缺失？

We can still sell it, and even **marginally（稍微）** improve it. But it’s not new anymore—it no longer offers exciting growth opportunities.

我们仍旧可以销售该产品，甚至稍微改良一下，但这已经不是新产品了，它再也不能带来令人兴奋的增长机会。

Absolutely. **Nothing at all like what he’d recorded up till then**—I mean, before that, Miles Davis played things so complex that … well, nobody could touch him.

学生：绝对是！在那之前，没有和他的唱片一样的音乐。我是说，在那之前，迈尔斯·戴维斯弹奏的曲子都太复杂了， 没人听得懂。

Well, he’d lay out the general outline, the theme, and then give each of these star performers, one by one, the creative freedom to really show what they could do with it on their own instrument … to **improvise*(即兴表演)** and add something new, but always within the same general theme.


So the teacher helps motivate and focus each child and monitors the child's progress, but does not interfere with the child's observations and **deductions(演绎 推论，减少)**.

因此，教师要去激励和关注每个孩子，并监督孩子的进步，但不干扰孩子的观察和推断。



But this apparent play is laying the **groundwork** for later math and language work.

但这种表面上的游戏为以后的数学和语言学习打下了基础。

Similarly, with Practical Life equipment, the child can learn how to **button a shirt, cut up an apple for a snack,** and, uh, other real-world tasks.

同样，通过日常生活设备，孩子可以学习如何扣衬衫，切苹果来制作小食以及其他现实世界的任务。

Well, I guess you might think that, but when I saw it back then it was **anything but(一点也不)** boring!

And, and suddenly it stops and **preens**--you know, it takes a few moments to **straighten** its feathers--and then returns to the mating ritual.

突然停下，花一些时间去整理自己的羽毛，然后又回到交配状态。

This kind of behavior-- this doing something that seems completely **out of place**--is what we call a displacement activity.

这种行为，这种似乎完全突发性发生的行为，就是我们所说的“转移行为”。

Displacement activities are activities that animals engage in when they have conflicting drives—if, if we take our example from a minute ago—if, if the bird is afraid of its mate, it's conflicted, it wants to mate, but it's also afraid and wants to run away, so instead it starts **grooming** itself.

转移行为指的是当动物遇到冲突性驱动时的某些行为。我们看一下刚刚举到的例子，如果那只鸟害怕其交配伙伴，它便面临着冲突。它想交配，但也因为害怕想逃离。所以，反之，它开始整理自己的羽毛。

Displacement occurs because the animal's got two conflicting drives, two competing urges, in this case, fear and hunger—and what happens is they **inhibit** each other—they cancel each other out in a way, and a third, seemingly irrelevant behavior surfaces … through a process that we call disinhibition.

转移发生的时候动物是面临着两种冲突的驱动，两种相互矛盾的冲动，在这个例子中，就是恐惧和饥饿。而接下来发生的就是，两者会相互抑制，他们会以某种方式相互抵消，而此时第三方，似乎毫无相关的行为就会出现，我们称之为“抑制解除”。


For example, there's a bird–the wood thrush, anyway when the wood thrush is in an attack-escape conflict—that is, it's caught between the two urges to escape from or attack an enemy—if it's sitting on a horizontal branch, it'll **wipe** its **beak** on its **perch（P251 鸟的）栖木，栖枝；高处，高位）**.

比如说，有一种叫画眉的鸟。不管怎样，当画眉鸟遇到进攻或逃离的冲突时，即当画眉鸟出于要不逃跑危险要不进攻敌人的境地时，如果它是停在水平树枝上的话，它会将自己的喙往栖木上磨


Most of us aren't in touch with ourselves, in a way, so we just aren't capable of recognizing **profound P218（影响）深刻的，极大的；（感情）强烈的，深切的；（思想）深邃的，（见解）深刻的；<文>深的，深处的；完全的；艰深的，玄奥的；（疾病，残疾）严重的）** truths.

我们很多人不能够以某种方式认识到自己，所以我们不能够领悟到深刻的真理。


They try to fit in with the rest of the world, even though it's **at odds with** their beliefs and their identities.

尽管他们的行为与自己的信念和身份**不一致**，他们还是试着融入到其他人的世界中去。

You know, uh, college being a time to **sort of（有点）** really think about who you are and where you're going.

你知道的，大学的时候，你们就必须考虑自己的定位和发展方向。


I mean, I can **attest** to that. Before I was a literature professor, I was an accountant. Before that, I was a newspaper reporter.

我想这点我可以证明。在我还不是文学教授的时候，我当过会计。在那之前，我是一名报社记者。

It's about United States Supreme Court decisions. We're looking at the impact of recent cases on **property rights**, **municipal(P158 城市的，市政的；自治城市的，地方自治的；内政的)** land use cases, **zoning** disputes…

学生：是关于美国最高法院决议。我们正在研究最近的案子对美国产权，城市用地法案，所有权冲突的影响。

Oh, it's just a term that describes this situation: when people in a group seek to get the benefits of being in the group without contributing to the work…Anyway, what exactly do you mean when you say they just **sit back**? I mean, they've been filing their weekly progress reports with me…

教授：啊，就是指一组人在没有给组里做出贡献的情况下还想得到好处的情况。不管怎样。你说他们**袖手旁观**是怎样的情况？我的意思是，因为一直都有完成每周的进度报告。


I went off to the stacks and found some really good material for my part, but when I got back to our table they were just **goofing off(犯愚蠢的错误；消磨时间，闲荡；游手好闲，开小差（goof off）；过量服用（违禁药品）；取笑，奚落（goof on）)** and talking.

我在书架上找到对我负责的部分很好的资料，但当我回去的时候，他们却在偷懒聊天。

I know, but I didn't want to risk the project going down the drain.

学生：我知道，但是那样的话项目可能**流于无形**，我可不想冒险。

But, we've already got all the sources. And it's due next week. We don't have time to **start from scratch**.

学生：但我们所有材料都准备了，下周就到期了。我们没有时间从头再来。

Uh, some people might say that, but wasn't the primary **objective** of the Federal Art Project to provide jobs?

教授：呃，有人会这么说。但联邦艺术项目的最初目的不是为了给人们提供工作吗？

The idea was that there’d be a federal **subsidy(P350 补贴，津贴，补助金)**, uh, financial assistance to artists and artistic or cultural institutions.

当时的想法是联邦政府会提供补贴。嗯，呃，给艺术家和艺术的或文化机构的财政援助。


Well, you see, corporations aren't always **altruistic（P108 利他主义的，无私的）**, they might not support the arts unless . . . well, unless the government made it attractive for them to do so, by offering corporations tax incentives to support the arts—that is by letting corporations pay less in taxes if they were patrons of the arts.

教授：嗯，你知道的，公司可不总是奉行利他主义。他们可能不会支持艺术，除非政府给他们点甜头，所以通过提供公司捐税鼓励支持艺术的做法，让公司成为艺术的支持者，从而减轻其税负。



And the Kennedy and Lincoln centers aren’t the only examples—many of your cultural **establishments（机构，组织：一个组织或机构，通常是商业、政府或社会性质的。）** in the United States will have a **plaque（P匾牌，匾额，纪念匾；牙斑，齿菌斑；（医）斑（块）；动脉斑块；（微生物）空斑，噬斑；（用于赌博的扁平）筹码）** somewhere acknowledging the support, the money, they’ve received from whatever corporation. Yes, Janet?

而肯尼迪和林肯中心只是其中之一的个例。美国的很多文化机构都有这样那样的铭牌以表明其支持艺术—不管他们从哪些公司获得的资助。哦，Janet？


Well, there are about as many individuals who disagree with government support as there are those who agree—in fact, with artists in particular, you have lots of artists who support—and who have benefitted from—this agency, al–although it seems that just as many artists **oppose** a government agency being involved in the arts for many different reasons—reasons like they don’t want the government to control what they create.

嗯，不赞同政府支持艺术的人和赞同的人的数量相当。事实上，特别是艺术家，我们有很多艺术家支持这些机构，并从中受益。尽管似乎很多艺术家想政府机构参与到艺术行业中去，原因各种各样，像他们不想让政府限制他们创作。

# 模考5 15分

 Listen to a conversation between a student and a **counselor（p127 顾问 律师）** at the University Counseling Center.



Hi, thanks for seeing me on such short notice

“你好，谢谢你这么快安排时间见我。”

解析：

- thanks for seeing me → “谢谢你见我”
- on such short notice → “在这么短的通知时间内” → 表示临时约见，对方迅速安排了时间

🔹 这句话常用于商务或正式场合，比如临时约见上司、客户或医生时，表达感谢对方抽出时间。

That's an **understatement(p150 不充分的陈述，以退为进的陈述；淡化，轻描淡写)**.

学生：还不止这些。

I'm taking mostly **introductory** courses and some are taught in these huge lecture halls.

学生：我现在正在上一些入门课程，有些是在大讲堂里面进行的。

**In either case** I wouldn't take it personally.

不管怎么说，我个人不认同你说的。


They've been searching **high and low for a replacement**, someone with experience.

他们一直到处找一个能演奏的人顶替他的位置。

Now we can't really talk about fairy tales without first talking about folk tales because there's a strong connection between these two **genres(P304  体裁，类型；风俗画)**, these two types of stories.

教授：在讲童话之前我们要讲一下民谣，因为这两种不同类型的故事之间有很紧密的关联。

Um, <u>not the plot, the details of what happens in the story would remain constant.</u>

<u>嗯，故事中的情节和细节都不会一成不变。</u>

What's the **line-up**? How do all those stories start?

童话故事是怎么进展的呢？故事是怎么开始的呢？


Because of this, elements like place and time can no longer be **tailored** to suit a particular audience.

因此，故事发生的地点和时间不再适合某一特定的听众。


So you get more details about the characters, about where the action takes place, what people's houses were like, um, whether they're small **cabins(P371 小木屋；船舱；机舱，客舱)** or grand **palaces(王宫，（官位极高者的）府邸；住在王宫里的人)**.

这样你得到更多人物的细节信息，故事发生的地点，人物所住的房子什么样，额，他们是否住在小平房中还是宏伟的宫殿

 To **eliminate(P349 剔除，根除；对……不予考虑，)** a possible definition of the term” fairy tale”
