## Set2 

It's an outdoor scene, an everyday scene, it's kind of **bleak(*adj.*不乐观的，无望的；无遮掩的，荒凉的；)**, but you can really see those **broad** **brushstrokes(*n.*一笔；笔的一划；绘画技巧)**, and the **blurry(*adj.*模糊不清的)** lines.

这是一个户外场景，日常生活场景，它（看上去）有点凄凉，看着这些粗大、模糊的线条

And the Sales Barn, it was basically this place where the local farmers bought and sold their **cattle**, their farm animals.

Sales Barn 基本上是当地农民买卖牲畜、家畜的地方。

Good. One other painting I really want you to look at is of a young woman surrounded by **pumpkins**.You will notice that the woman's face is so realistic looking that it's almost like a photograph.The woman's nose is a little less than perfect and her hair is kind of messed up—This is realism.But then, the background of the painting—this woman with the pumpkins is wrapped in a blanket of broad thick brushstrokes, and—it's all kinds of **zigzagging** brushstrokes and lines, kind of chaotic almost when you look at it close.And there are **vibrant** colors—There's lots of orange, with little hints of an **electric blue peeking out**.

很好。我很希望你们看的另外一幅是一个年轻的女子被南瓜环绕的画。你会注意到那女人的脸是如此的逼真，就像是一张照片。这幅画里妇女的鼻子真是太真实了，还有她那乱蓬蓬的头发也是， 这就是写实派。但是，你看这幅画的背景，这个南瓜地里的妇女被一块地毯围着，而这个地毯是用粗犷的线条（broad thick brushstrokes 之前在说印象主义时提到的）所勾画的，并且这些线条都有点锯齿状的，当你近看的时候甚至有点乱乱的。而且有鲜明的色彩—有很多的橙色，摇曳着少量的铁蓝色。
