Awesome! Here's a step-by-step **machine learning improvement plan** tailored to you, especially considering you're using Python and PyTorch:

---

### 🔰 **Stage 1: Foundation Building (Weeks 1–2)**

**Goal**: Strengthen core ML concepts, Python, and PyTorch basics.  
**Topics**:

-   Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
    
-   Linear Regression, Logistic Regression
    
-   Loss functions, gradient descent
    
-   PyTorch basics: tensors, autograd, simple models


**Project**:  
🧠 **Boston Housing Prices Prediction**

-   **Dataset**: `sklearn.datasets.load_boston()` (or [Kaggle version](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altavish/boston-housing-dataset))
    
-   **Why**: Clean, small, interpretable regression dataset
    
-   **What to do**: Train a linear regression model using PyTorch, implement training loop manually.
    

---

### 🚀 **Stage 2: Image Classification + CNNs (Weeks 3–4)**

**Goal**: Learn Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and basic training workflows.  
**Topics**:

-   CNN layers: conv, pooling, dropout, etc.
    
-   Optimizers (SGD, Adam)
    
-   Data augmentation
    

**Project**:  
📷 **Handwritten Digit Recognition**

-   **Dataset**: MNIST (built into `torchvision.datasets`)
    
-   **Why**: Beginner-friendly, perfect for CNN training
    
-   **What to do**: Train a CNN from scratch, visualize predictions, experiment with different architectures.
    

---

### 🧩 **Stage 3: Tuning + Intermediate Architectures (Weeks 5–6)**

**Goal**: Explore model tuning, deeper networks, and better evaluation.  
**Topics**:

-   Overfitting, regularization, validation
    
-   Learning rate scheduling, weight decay
    
-   Saving/loading models
    

**Project**:  
🎨 **Fashion Item Classification**

-   **Dataset**: FashionMNIST
    
-   **Why**: Similar to MNIST but harder; good for tuning practice
    
-   **What to do**: Try deeper CNNs, batch normalization, and data augmentation.
    

---

### 🌍 **Stage 4: Real-world Projects (Weeks 7–8)**

**Goal**: Apply ML to messier, real-world datasets. Learn data preprocessing & cleaning.  
**Topics**:

-   Preprocessing pipelines
    
-   Dealing with missing values, noisy data
    
-   Multiclass classification
    

**Project**:  
🔍 **Fake News Detection**

-   **Dataset**: [Kaggle Fake News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data)
    
-   **Why**: NLP + real-world messiness
    
-   **What to do**: Use Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, then move to simple RNN/LSTM using PyTorch.
    

---

### 🧠 **Stage 5: Advanced Topics Preview (Weeks 9–10)**

**Goal**: Taste of modern DL — transfer learning & transformers.  
**Topics**:

-   Transfer learning (e.g., ResNet pretrained models)
    
-   Introduction to Hugging Face transformers
    

**Project**:  
🦾 **Image Classifier with Transfer Learning**

-   **Dataset**: CIFAR-10 or tiny ImageNet
    
-   **What to do**: Use pretrained ResNet18, fine-tune on CIFAR-10.
    

Optional:  
💬 **Sentiment Analysis**

-   **Dataset**: IMDB Movie Reviews (via `torchtext`)
    
-   **Model**: Pretrained BERT from Hugging Face

### 📝 Final Tip

For each project, write a short blog-style report:

-   What problem you solved
    
-   Your approach and key decisions
    
-   What worked and what didn’t
    
-   Visualizations, graphs, results
    

It’ll help with memory, reflection, and future résumé building!
